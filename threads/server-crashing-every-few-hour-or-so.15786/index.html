                        constantly every few hours with no errors at all to show it we use tcadmin and everything our server has more then enough ram to run the servers that are on it we though
                        plugins and removing them all fixed it but adding just one made it start up again this only started after the last update anyone know any possiable fixes or any ways my client
                        can minimize the crashing with his plugins? <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>

                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> for me i had a issue with a server crashing when someone or me removed building parts.<br /> Seemed to be a
                        corrupt save file because when i reverted back to a older savefile a few ours earlier the problem was gone. <br />
                        <br /> Do it crash with ANY kind of plugin added? or does it crash with a specific plugin?<br />
                        <br /> i would do list of things before i redo it all but hard to sitt here and do a megapost on all kinds of things <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}"
                            class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie8" alt=":D" title="Big Grin    :D" />. <br />
                        <br /> but..<br /> (i will write this as if you are almost a nub but i am not assuming you are a idiot because of it <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}"
                            class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" />). <br /> if at all possible after clients approval i would do a complete restart of the
                        &quot;project&quot; for this client. <br /> As in i would writecfg, save, quit (in that order) and hope it closes propperly. or if already crashed <img
                            src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie8" alt=":D" title="Big Grin    :D" />. <br />
                        <br /> Then backup whole folder. just rename the steamfolder that you use to install it. <br /> Then redo all my starter steps with downloading steamcmd, check so the folder i
                        pick to install the steamcmd and the appcache files is a completely fresh with new names different from before.<br /> (when i wipe my server i go from
                        c:\xxx1\server1\steamcmd.exe to c:\xxx2\server2\steamcmd.exe to c:\xxx3\server3\steamcmd.exe and so on after each wipe generation). <br />
                        <br /> then i install with the bat i use in that new specific folder :<br />
                        <div class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeCode">
                            <div class="type">Code:</div>
                            {% raw %}<pre>@C:\xxx2\server2\steamcmd.exe +login anonymous +force_install_dir C:\xxx2\server2\rustdedicated\ +app_update 258550 validate +quit
pause</pre>{% endraw %}
                        </div>Then i download a new zip of the newest oxide, and then newest rustio version.<br /> thus completely 100% fresh install<br />
                        <br /> Now it has no plugins however besides rustio (wich is a plugin i doubt is causing this when server is not overloaded). <br />
                        <br /> What i would do then is redownload manually every single plugin from the websites FRESH.. <br /> and adding them one by one. <br /> But since it is &quot;randomly&quot;
                        crashing it is hard to say what specific plugin it is since you cant spend 5 hours playing with one plugin each <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}"
                            class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie8" alt=":D" title="Big Grin    :D" />. <br /> But so far you have no old datafolder and no old config files (config files i would prefer to
                        config when the plugins is added. incase there is something added in them that actually breaks a plugin that magicaly breaks the server). <br /> You also have no old save file
                        and userpercistance.db. <br /> And if he used signature artist then he also has no storage.db file.<br />
                        <br /> If the server crashes after adding the plugins then one or more of the plugins is causing the crash and you have a guessing game on your hand trying to find what plugin
                        it is. <br /> Any plugin that adds entitys or manipulates ingame entitys or manipulates player BPs or inventory and such is more likely to cause a corrupt savefile, storagefile
                        or userpercistance.<br />
                        <br /> If the server runs flawless with all his lovely plugins. <br /> Then i would copy+paste the backed up save file and userpercistance<br /> Adding plugin data is something
                        that requires a FULL shutdown, same with storage.db for pictures on signs and savefile. <br />
                        <br /> if it is still live and well after you restored all this then you have a fixed server and we are all happy and cheerfull. <br /> If not, then one of the added files has
                        caused it, thus corrupt save file, or corrupt storage.db (i had corrupt storage.db aswell but it only crashed specific clients, not whole server).<br />
                        <br /> The next step is to try a older .sav file (0 is newest, 9 is oldest. and hope for it to not be all 10 old and corrupt saves). <br />
                        <br /> I hope this helps and was understandable <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie8" alt=":D" title="Big Grin    :D" />. its harder to
                        give a quick guide then doing it myself. <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />
