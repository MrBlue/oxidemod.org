                        <br /> Hey I was curious to know if anyone would be interested in tutoring myself in programming, specifically plugin development for rust.<br /> I have been working on a few
                        plugins but my knowledge is limited to what I&#039;ve picked up by studying/modifying other plugins and I get stuck quite often. I would like to learn more and I pick things up
                        quite fast. It would be good to have someone that I could bounce ideas off and who could explain to me how to do things and why im doing it, to give me a better understanding
                        of how it all works. If I had done things differently many years ago I wouldve studied programming properly but unfortunately work/life gets in the way <img

                        in doing something like this, Im 27 years old and for some reason have recently acquired a interest in programming, I&#039;ve been spending most of my free time tinkering with
                        everything and would love to get some assistance.<br /> I&#039;m hoping to maybe do a few sessions a week and I am happy to pay for your time<br /> How we go about doing it can
                        be discussed if any interest is shown<br />
                        <br /> If anyone is interested pm on here.<br />
                        <br /> Thanks, k1ll <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
