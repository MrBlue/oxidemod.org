                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml">My skill set is primarily in the area of web development... I&#039;ve never really done much low level or desktop
                        related stuff and haven&#039;t ever used any .NET technologies for the web.<br />
                        <br /> I understand the differences between access modifiers, but my question is this: Why don&#039;t Oxide&#039;s hooks need access modifiers? How are they being accessed?
                        Based on my reading, C# defaults to &#039;internal&#039; when an access modifier is not explicitly set. However, when explicitly setting the hooks to &#039;internal&#039; or
                        &#039;protected&#039; they log an error stating &quot;Unable to call hook directly.&quot;<br />
                        <br /> When setting them to &#039;public&#039; it&#039;s as if they&#039;re never executed.<br /> When setting them to &#039;private&#039; they seem to function fine.<br />
                        <br /> This is a rather confusing pattern of behavior seeing as &#039;public&#039; is supposed to be more accessible than &#039;private&#039;... <div

                        able to call a hook on plugin B which is the reason why hooks need to have the private access modifier (or none which defaults to private in that case). <div
