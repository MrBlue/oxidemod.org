                        work using zone manager and zone command , so im giving up on them .<br /> if anyone could make for me a plugin that on connect or after universalui has finished showing rules
                        ect ,that a button or 2 buttons show on screen and a player can pick pve or pvp so if pve is picked that doesnt need to do any thing as i have c4 satchel and rockets blocked
                        and pve zones with pvpgod undstl ect on , but if they click pvp the permission itemsblocker.bypass is granted and they can craft and use the c4 ect.<br /> i have tested the
                        permission just by granting it to myself and it works for the c4 , iv tried putting a button on universalui , zone manager with or without zone command , putting a command in
                        zone command /zcmd add 2660604 on enter {perm.grant user $player.id itemsblocker.bypass} when entering the zone but nothing is working . the only way i could get it to work was
                        in server rewards creating a commond for purchase but that still defeats the object as i have to tell players to find it then use it but then PVE players also can do that and
                        raid but not be raided ?<br /> so i am in a pickle .<br /> Thanks simon <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
