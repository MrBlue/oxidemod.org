                        <br /> Hook admin, dedicated server on a know working PC (specs are crap but 256fps when running server at 50% CPU load)<br />
                        <br /> So was going to complain about not having fun with my server since about mid december, I felt that a variety of bugs or something was making my server a pain to manage
                        and to be honest I was feeling like one more crash and I would find something more constructive to do with my time.<br />
                        <br /> But decided to look at my concerns and research a bit then ask for information to make my server great again <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}"
                            class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
                        <br /> a). I believe when the storage folder gets large that my server has trouble with startup.<br /> (perhaps a plugin is trying to be awesome and fix stuff but the server
                        does not load well)<br />
                        <br /> To look into this further typed quit at the console my trusted bat file restarts the server, checks steam for update replaces all the oxide files and downloads and
                        updates.<br /> then I grab the latest oxide.zip and install the 58 files and run the server.<br />
                        <br /> I then see on the server screen:-<br /> Starting Server...<br /> Command Line: (then my commandline arguments)<br /> &lt;the gaps here with a 7GB storage folder is large
                        (i stopped it at 12 minutes)&gt;<br /> Server Config Loaded does not appear within 12 minutes<br /> on a windows 8.1 PC with the server running locally (unacceptable in 2016,
                        normal in 2017)<br />
                        <br /> If I delete the storage folder it loads in 12 seconds or less<br />
                        <br />

                        </div>So what i happening between the commandline display and Server Config Loaded?<br />
                        <br /> Anyone know a way to find out which plugins are using the storage?<br /> Do people have a list of plugins that are know offenders?<br />
                        <br /> Can I change the permissions on the storage folder to stop plugins writing to the folder?<br />
                        <br /> Outcome im trying to achieve.<br /> 1. Allow the server to startup in a reasonable time<br /> (because im not confident that I understand the server and sit and watch
                        each manual startup)<br />
                        <br /> 2. Still allow people to write on signs in the game and draw etc.<br />
                        <br /> Find out which of my addons im willing to sacrifice to obtain the above?<br /> 01 &quot;Better Chat&quot; (5.0.3) by LaserHydra (0.00s)<br /> 02

                        <br /> Plugins I have removed due to suspected storage abuse or suspected out of date etc.<br /> BetterLoot.cs<br /> CleanUp.cs<br /> CraftUI.cs<br /> DevilsIsland.cs<br />
                        GUIShop.cs<br /> HumanitySystem.cs<br /> HumanNPC.cs<br /> LootConfig.cs<br /> PathFinding.cs<br /> RadtownAnimals.cs<br /> RemoverTool.cs<br /> ServerRewards.cs<br />
                        Spawns.cs<br /> StructureGrades.cs<br /> Waypoints.cs<br />
                        <br /> So i&#039;m keen for some information to allow me to make an informative decision<br />
                        <br /> Hook.<br />
                        <br /> p.s. Plugins I feel I must have to make my server unique<br /> &quot;InfoPanel&quot;<br /> CleanUp.cs (administratiove, not needed for features)<br />
                        &quot;ComponentBlocker&quot;<br /> &quot;Death Notes&quot;<br /> &quot;EasyVote&quot;<br /> &quot;PlayerChallenges&quot;<br /> &quot;Timed Execute&quot; (administratiove, not
                        needed for features)<br /> &quot;ZoneManager&quot;<br /> &quot;Zeiser Levels Remastered&quot;<br />
                        <br /> and I really want to put the NPC&#039;s back when its fixed.<br /> HumanNPC.cs<br /> PathFinding.cs<br /> Waypoints.cs<br />
                        <br /> Finally as i&#039;m writing this with 1 player connected to the server I get the following line in the server console<br /> Image loading fail! Error: transfer closed
                        with 99629 bytes remaining to read<br /> (unrelated or a clue to my startup problems?)<br />
                        <br /> I originally though my issue was a server will not start error, now I KNOW I have isolated it to the storage as removal of the storage fixes the startup problem.<br />
                        <br /> Information, feedback, suggests and post moving welcome.<br /> [DOUBLEPOST=1485177804][/DOUBLEPOST]Update, just checked the server and the storage folder is back (no
                        surprise)<br /> however I have a folder storage/2135811/0 with 16,179 files is 3.65 GB<br />
                        <br /> started deleting mods (started with ImageLibrary) and deleted the storage folder which had grown to 7GB again. Now its sitting at 195 files (app 1MB). <br /> Note
                        LustyMap has not finished creating the map. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
