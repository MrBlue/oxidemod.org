                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> So i wondered how to keep track of when a new RUST patch would come. <br /> i know there is some softwares and so
                        on that will notify me when the update is RELEASED. <br /> But i would want to know BEFORE that &quot;in about a hour or 5 a update is coming&quot;. <br /> Or atleest the
                        day.<br /> I am having a hard time finding clear information of when releases is actually done. <br /> Oxide i undersand will release to snapshot and then to live as soon as
                        possible, AFTER rust update is released. <br /> Thats a given and fully understandable. <br /> But rust itself i hear many different things. <br /> And we have had 2 or 3
                        protocol id changes past month. <br /> And those are the most important changes i wish to keep track of.<br /> As they affect that people can no longer join the server. <div
