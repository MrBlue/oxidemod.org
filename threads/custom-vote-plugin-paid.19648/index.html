                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml">Hey guys was just wondering is there anyone out there that can make a new vote plugin for me. The plugin i was
                        using was <a href="http://oxidemod.org/plugins/vote-checker-rewarder.1216/" class="internalLink">Vote Checker &amp; Rewarder for Rust | Oxide</a> and i had another plugin guy
                        mod to give a global chat message in chat that said:<br />
                        <br /> [Radium] Judico88 has VOTED! and has received 1x Supply Signal! Go to <a href="https://rust-servers.net/server/76550/" target="_blank" class="externalLink  rel="
                            nofollow">[UK/EU] RadiumRust #1 [09/06]|ActiveAdmins|Events|TP|x5|Kits|iCraft | Rust server</a> and VOTE! to received your REWARD!<br />
                        <br /> Worked fine for a while but then i noticed a bug with the plugin where people could spam vote and get reward every hour or so some could do it some could not. Then
                        others would just join server for the first time and go to my vote page vote come back type /getreward and they would have a 15 min cooldown but when they would wait the 15
                        mins type command again it would say cool down 20 mins and so on like that.<br />
                        <br /> What i need it a new one made from ground up so i know there wont be any mistakes.<br />
                        <br /> I have 2 servers now so id like to add in a feature where if they vote on the server they are playing on they will get a supply signal and a global message to chat
                        saying who voted and where to go to vote as said in above message. But the new thing i wanted to add was if they vote for the two servers they can get a free Level up for each
                        server on command and a global message that said:<br />
                        <br /> [Radium] Judico88 has VOTED! on both server and has now received a free LEVEL UP! Type /vote to get links to voting pages!<br />
                        <br /> Features:<br />
                        <br /> 1. 2 global messages as said above.<br /> 2. Add global messages into config for color editing and message editing.<br /> 3. Vote on one server get a supply
                        signal.<br /> 4. Vote on two servers and received a free level up.<br /> 5. Command for finding where to go to vote<br />
                        <br /> This plugin needs to be new as the one that&#039;s there is far broken and not sure it can be fixed. Iv had 4 plugins guys mod this for me, all plugins had same problem
                        so its not the plugin guys its the original plugin that is at fault and no one can find the problem if u see the support part of trend you will see its blown up with
                        problems<br />
                        <br /> Looking forward to hearing for you guys! <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
