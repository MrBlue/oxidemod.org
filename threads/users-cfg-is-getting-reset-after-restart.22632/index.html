                        </div>Not that I really know of. We don&#039;t have any Admin plugins, and the only one that manages users is SecureAdmin. There might be an obscure thing so I&#039;ll take a
                        look <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
                        <br /> PS. In the other thread to do with server crashes, do you know if there&#039;s anything on the server side we can change to avoid those errors? Sorry I don&#039;t mean
                        to bring it up here I&#039;m just not sure if you&#039;ve seen it, and it&#039;s driving players crazy all the restarts. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
