                        like how the teleportation plugins changed servers . The idea is the admin or whoever is in charge can set areas of the map to basically give players rewards so in the forms of
                        for example if your within the area in all the chests within it you config for 1000 wood to be deposited in all chests every so often lets say 30seconds. This will then allow
                        clans battling for the territories or access to the land to get a significant advantage over ones that dont have it.<br />
                        <br /> Another example is if on purpose you remove all the trees on the map and there are areas that give you wood in each chest every 10seconds then it would provide a massive
                        central location for pvp for the players needing that. I hope that made sense what do you think?<br />
                        <br /> In addition to this there can be integration with the kits plugin to allow access to certain kits if you are within that area which could easily be a building for
                        example or a /build created forrest. There could also be things like temporary abilities that allow you to /heal. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
