                        I run Dark Ages Medieval rust. It&#039;s a no kill on sight server. So enforcing said rule is pretty hard I was wondering if there is a way to create like a zone around a
                        player and when players come in contact with another player and the zones intersect if there could be a delay of pvp for 30 seconds or not enable pvp til they were in contact
                        for 30 seconds or some way to do something to that extent. So it gives people the time to roleplay, talk, and etc before killing to help resolve alot of the headache of
                        enforcing kos. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>

                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> My personal input is that a mod dev might have to look at a more effective way of doing this, I say this as
                        having a zone update often to keep it as close to the players position might be to resource heavy while refreshing the zone permission less often might cause problems when two
                        zones intersect when they shouldn&#039;t.<br />
                        <br /> A possible solution would be to use the on damage command, when a player attacks another player no damage will happen but a timer will start, this means once the timer
                        passes damage would be enabled.<br />
                        <br /> How you could do this is on a hit check if there names in a group so for example if PersonA hits PersonB then the mod add 2 groups one called PersonA and the other
                        PersonB inside that group would be everyone that they can attack. If that person has his down group and the enemy is in that group then damage is dealt, if not then there
                        information is added to a temp group for 30 seconds from where after the timer ticks over it creates that group.<br />
                        <br /> It sounds a bit messy/complicated, but this solution might allow more flexibility for example in the temp group maybe you only create a group for people who got hit and
                        put the attackers in the group. If the person hits back at the attacked he will do some damage while the attacker cant do damage, this stops the attacker from just running
                        after the guy with a bow and gives the defender a chance to fight or make space.<br />
                        <br /> Sorry for the length. I might look into making this mod at a later date if someone else doesn&#039;t make this version first. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;
