                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> So here is what I was thinking about. I like to reward the players of my server with an extra little starter kit.
                        However to get something out of the deal for myself i&#039;ve made the requirements be that they must join our steam group to get added to the starter kit group in game.
                        i&#039;ve also done this same concept for our discord, where my players will get a small starter-home kit for joining our discord. Now the issue has become that I am manually
                        adding the players as they join the group. If I am offline and a player joins they do not instantly get the reward of being added to the group. So basically I would like a mod
                        that has the ability to check if the player has joined our steam group or discord and reward them by adding them to the respective groups in game .<br />
                        <br /> Anyone know if that is a possible thing to happen? I know very little of coding so I would be of little to no help with the process of making it from scratch. <br />
                        <br /> Any help or information on this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.<br />
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <br /> So after a long bit of searching I found this mod:<br />
                        <a href="{{ '/threads/steamgroups.20384/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="internalLink">SteamGroups</a><br />
                        <br /> Which solves half of what I am trying to do. Anyone know if this mod can also be somehow used to do the same thing with discord? Thanks again. <div
