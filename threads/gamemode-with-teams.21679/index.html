                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> Can you please tell how to make or use any plugins.<br /> At the beginning of the game blocked the movement of
                        the players, and the players are invulnerable, until all guys joins the server. Then, the administrator enters a command for example: / start. Then the players are
                        automatically divided into two teams randomly. In Team1 - three players, and Team2 - seven players, or two against five, or one against three players respectively. In Team2
                        should always be more players. Thereafter Team1 respawn at a random location in the region 1, and similarly in Team2 region 2. Then distributed the kits to all players to
                        different teams a different set of kits. Suppose in Team1 each player is given a pistol, and Team2 each player is given a bow. Next you need to do to Team1 could not build
                        outside region 1. You also need to make to Team2 could not build outside the region 2.<br />
                        <br /> at the beginning of the game will start a timer, for example 1 hour.<br /> And if time passes, Team2 wins.<br /> At the beginning of the game, player of team2 receives
                        the item, for example - Pookie Bear. This item should be put somewhere in the house. And this item can not be cast, can only be installed in the room. The subject is given a
                        just one, and it can not be crafting. If Team1 killing of a player who has this item, then Team1 wins. If Team1 destroys already installed in the room Pookie Bear, they also
                        wins. Team1 task is to destroy the walls and destroy the Pookie Bear and do so sooner than the timer is destroyed. Task Team2 put Pookie Bear at home and defend it. If time of
                        timer is over, game displays a message to all: winning Team2. If Pookie Bear destroyed, the message to everyone: Team1 won. In any case of victory, all players must be
                        immobilized, and the players are invulnerable, and the screen should appear scoreboard. Then, if the administrator inputs a command for example: / restart - it must reset the
                        game world.<br />
                        <br /> I can use plugins - kits, screentimer, timed events, event manager.. what else you advise? <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
