                        cringe and terrified to be a server admin. Is anything even being done about this? I have seen little to no blog-posts or updates in regards to security and anti-cheat both on
                        Steam/Valve side and Facepunch. What do you guys think?<br />

                                        are within normal parameters; i.e. no extra code has been embedded or is being sent that allows people these additional features. However my forte is not with
                                        coding, it is solely with networking. I can harden the hell out of a Linux box, Apache, databases, Cpanels and email, not so much a Rust game server <img

                        </div>I didn&#039;t say anything about better server sided protection, but that a global ban as a result of a server sided anti cheat detection isn&#039;t possible, because
                        server owners would just be able to spoof the server files to get people added to the global ban database.<br /> What you just described is already provided by EAC. EAC is
                        doing a lot of bounds checks. Keep in mind that servers *cannot* be too strict with bound checks, as things like packet loss can trigger a false detection as well. That&#039;s
                        why some things, like slight speedhacks or slight jump boosts, are possible, and there&#039;s no good way to protect against that.<br /> Most things in the video are done on
                        the client side. Only VAC can help, and there&#039;s nothing you can do about it. I imagine keeping VAC for Rust up to date is one hell of a job. <div
