                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> Hello everyone!<br />
                        <br /> I&#039;m not sure if requests are allowed, so I apologise if they&#039;re not. However, I do have a request for a plugin idea that I have come up with which I would like
                        to use on a project I am starting:<br />
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <br /> Scraps (the currency for my server) and other items can be stored in a “safety deposit box” in a bank. All items are stored in a physical storage container, and so can
                        still be stolen. However, there is a lot of security within the bank that protects from robbery.<br />
                        <br /> When players first store items in the bank they must pay an “account opening fee”. They then place the items they wish to deposit into a storage box in the bank lobby
                        and press “deposit”. This box can only be accessed by one person at a time. The items are then transferred from the lobby storage box into an empty storage box inside the
                        vault. The vault will be large enough to store items for every player on the server.<br />
                        <br /> When a player with vault items joins the server the items are automatically deposited into a storage box in the vault. They will remain there for as long as the player
                        is on the server. When the player logs off the server the items remain in the vault for 15 minutes or until that storage box is needed for another player who joins the server
                        with vault items (if there are no free storage boxes already).<br />
                        <br /> Players pay a fee every hour that their items are stored in the bank. The total fee must be paid before any of their items can be removed from the vault. Scraps stored
                        in the vault can also be used to pay the fee. The fee does not apply when the player is not on the server. Each player is only allowed one “safety deposit box” to prevent all
                        items being impossible to be stolen when the player is offline.<br />
                        <br />
                        <br /> I&#039;ve tried to cover all the possible bases with regards to exploiting, but if I have missed anything out please let me know. I&#039;m not a developer but I have
                        lots of ideas, so if someone wants to get involved with my project and develop my ideas that would be amazing!<br />
                        <br /> Thanks,<br /> Sam. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
