                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> I&#039;d like to make this game mode myself but I&#039;m getting a little overwhelmed with the programming. I
                        just wanted to throw this out there with some of the ideas and maybe one of you more experienced / productive guys might like to give it a bash! It&#039;s something that
                        I&#039;d like to play anyway!<br />
                        <br /> Fortress Assault<br />
                        <br /> A 32(?) player team based defend / assault mode with roles, on a set round timer. The attackers must attack the fortress and one of them must authorize on a cupboard
                        inside to win. The defenders must defend the cupboard.<br />
                        <br /> Some of the specifics I&#039;ve laid out prior to looking at the code were:<br />
                        <br /> When a player connects, they are assigned a team and teleported naked to an armoured room to select their kit. Hopefully get a GUI up in time so they can select the team
                        and kit easier if the teams aren&#039;t already unbalanced.<br /> When they select their kit, they will be teleported to their teams starting area and can spawn.<br /> Rounds
                        last for 8(?) minutes.<br /> If it&#039;s the start of a new round, the game will not start until there are at least two players sleeping in the spawn area for each team.<br />
                        <br /> Attackers:<br />
                        <br /> Demolitionist x 2 Max. Only class with C4, pistols only(?)<br /> Rocketeer(?) x 1 Max<br /> Rifleman infinite<br /> Assault infinite<br />
                        <br /> Other players must protect the demo guys.<br /> Respawn in armoured room to re-select kit(?). Needs looking at.<br /> Have large medkits and armour as balance to
                        defenders superior position.<br /> One of the attackers must authorize on the cupboard inside the fortress for the attackers to win.<br /> Attackers initially spawn further
                        away than the defenders, to give the defenders time to get into position.<br /> One attacker needs to authorize on a cupboard on the route up to the fortress to move the
                        attackers spawn point closer.<br />
                        <br />
                        <br /> Defenders:<br />
                        <br /> Rifleman infinite<br /> Assault infinite<br />
                        <br /> Must defend the fortress and stop the attackers authorizing on the cupboard to win.<br /> Spawn doesn&#039;t change and is closer than the attackers.<br /> Has less
                        armour than attackers and only bandages for first aid.<br />
                        <br /> Just a few of the things I was thinking anyway but yeah.. any thoughts? <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
