                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> I want to add a plugin that allows players to call a vote of some type. Pretty much exactly like SkipNightVote,
                        only I would like to be able to create custom votes that players can call and if they succeed the server will run a command that usually, only an admin could.<br />
                        <br /> I&#039;m trying to make the arena turn-key.<br /> I want people to come and go, start and stop all arena games without having to interact with too much stuff.<br /> EMI
                        right now is <i>way </i>too much to just hand to a player, and I can&#039;t see the voting system from EMI working realistically.<br />
                        <br /> I couldn&#039;t for the life of me even get EMI to utilize its voting system, but what I did get through was glitchy and I had no clue what I was doing because things I
                        expected to see I didn&#039;t, or things didnt pop-up properly and the only way I could continue the voting process was to close and reopen EMI multiple times..<br />
                        <br /> Though I love EMI for its admin purposes, I just think players will get lost in EMI, and I don&#039;t even want to think about explaining <i>that </i>process in
                        &#039;/help&#039;<br />
                        <br /> I want to call &#039;/vote arena&#039; in chat and if 2 or more players vote event opens. I have the events set to auto-close and time limits, so they could never really
                        go on forever even if no one joined.<br />
                        <br /> -I&#039;m open to alternative methods, if you have a different approach using other plugins please share <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}"
                            class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /> I just want it to be easy for <i>anyone </i> to participate in the arena, without spending too much time
                        messing with commands or plugins.<br />
                        <br />
                        <br /> *Solved*<br /> Used ServerRewards to sell the command to open an event for RP, doubles as a funnel and control for how much RP players gain from matches, since 1 kill =
                        1RP I can offset the profit with the cost of starting another game.<br />
                        <br /> I&#039;ll take it. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
