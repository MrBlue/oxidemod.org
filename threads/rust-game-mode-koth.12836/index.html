                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> if anyone want to take over this project feel free to do so . there are some parts missing that need to be
                        implemented .<br />
                        <br /> This project was dropped by the dev and no one that can finish it its just been sitting doing nothing<br />
                        <b><br /> King of the hill </b><br /> this is a game mode called King of the Hill. the point is to take over the current hill for as long as possible .the hill moves around so
                        players have to move to that position . its just like Halo games king of the hill . the dev used allot of features from Renebs plugins so thank you reneb<br />
                        <br /> Missing features :<br />
                        <br />
                        <b>A round circle circling the hill </b>: to show players where it is (We where thinking about using renebs code from the plugin Zones Manager . it hade a round ring that would
                        fit perfectly .) the ring would be there till the hill is gone then when the next hill activates the circle moves there instead . (We were also thinking of adding a arrow above
                        the ring so even if you where far away you would still be able to see it )<br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Scorebored</b>: we where planning on adding a score bored so if players press escape the would be able to see who is in the lead Kills,deaths,points.<br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Point system</b>: so standing in the hill would gain a player points.<br />
                        <br />
                        <b>FFA/TM</b>: basically 2 versions. a free for all and a teamdeathmatch depending on how many players want to play .<br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Random spawn point</b>: spawning players randomly . (ex termly hard to do for some reason)<br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Gear</b>: before the game starts a admin takes what ever he want the players to have and then does /KOTH gear 1 would copy the admins gear and give that gear to the first
                        team every round. (Admin would need to do this for every team so the wouldnt have the same shirts . free for all is a exception its basically point and shot so everyone uses
                        the same gear on that )<br />
                        <br />
