                        <br /> I&#039;m choosing a candidate for a public plugin that I&#039;ll be making next month. And apparently I&#039;ve come to blueprints.<br />
                        <br /> I want to make blueprint managing plugin with highly customizable settings from either config/chat/console.<br /> What I do need right now is to get a number of votes on
                        this and features that are missing in existing plugins so far. I do not play rust on a regular basis, so some things might not be obvious to me. <div

                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> Well there is one very important feature missing from all blueprint plugins that&#039;s been requested several
                        times and that I was about to write something for since nobody seems to want to take the bait on it but since you&#039;re proposing <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}"
                            class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
                        <br /> The request was to be able to do partial BP wipes. An admin could for example have a list of &quot;non-wipe&quot; blueprints (or the other way around, a list of
                        bp&#039;s that should wipe) or alternatively work by tier (wipe all BP&#039;s from the two top tiers for instance).<br />
                        <br /> This would allow admins to do partial BP wipes instead of full wipes. Players would lose access to high tier guns and raiding tools, but retain the ability to make basic
                        clothing/weapons/large box, etc.<br />
                        <br /> All the tools to do this exist, it&#039;s just a matter of putting it together and having a reliable mechanism to process this and not double-wipe or forget to wipe a
                        player, etc.<br />
                        <br /> The main issue here though is that there is no &quot;RemoveBlueprint&quot; functionality in Rust, so you basically need to make a list of what BP&#039;s the player has,
                        wipe them and then re-add what should be carried on.<br />
                        <br /> Also, I don&#039;t know if this can be done while players are offline? If not, it would complexify the whole process a bit, you&#039;d need to process player login and
                        only wipe him at that moment IF he hasn&#039;t been wiped before.<br />
                        <br /> I&#039;ve been wanting that for my own server for a while, just never got around to it but it was pretty much next on my list. If you want to take it over, be my guest,
                        I have more than enough project ideas on my plate <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />
