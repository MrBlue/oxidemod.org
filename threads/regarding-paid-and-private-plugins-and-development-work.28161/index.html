                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> Due to recent (and past) events and circumstances, I just wanted to point out a few things regarding private and
                        paid plugins, as well as a few of our forum rules and general purpose of this forum.<br />
                        <br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>When looking for private development work or a paid plugin, please be smart and cautious with who you are dealing with. Seeking out recommendations before deciding on a
                                developer would be advised, but make sure to follow the established forum rules when doing so.<br />
                                <br />
                            </li>
                            <li>Make sure to use a reliable and reputable payment method and avoid sharing any personally identifiable information. You never know who is behind the computer, even if
                                they may make magical plugins.<br />
                                <br />
                            </li>
                            <li>Keep in mind that third-party marketplaces as well as paid plugins are unsupported here. Please use the site you purchased them from or contact the author directly if
                                you have any issues, questions, or concerns. Threads or posts about any non-public plugins will be removed at the descretion of the moderators and/or admin.<br />
                                <br />
                            </li>
                            <li>If you are developing a plugin or doing development work for someone in exchange for money, please be sure to follow through with your work and provide support as
                                needed. If issues arise from a particular user where it is causing distress or otherwise abusing of fellow members, actions will be taken, which may involve account
                                warnings, temporary ban, or permanent ban from all Oxide-related services and sites.<br />
                                <br />
                            </li>
                            <li>While we discourage and do not accept direct copying (or forks) of code from other developers, we aren&#039;t going to deny a plugin being released if it shares a
                                similar feature set one not released here. We encourage plugins to developed and shared freely, though we understand that developers would often like to get more
                                compensation for their time spent that is often rare.<br />
                                <br />
                            </li>
                            <li>First and foremost, this is a support forum for the Oxide project and plugins provided on it. This is not a platform for disputing private issues or other matters.
                                We&#039;re here to support the project and its users with related matters and issues with it, not to mediate private transactions. If you are experiencing a sensitive
                                issue that would otherwise cause issues if posted publicly, please request that an administrator contact you privately. Keep in mind that conversations are not for
                                general support issues or specific plugin-related help, so please do not abuse this.</li>
                        </ul><br /> This may not cover everything, but hopefully it touches most of the key points and concerns. As always, this is subject to and at the descretion of the moderators
                        and/or site admin. We&#039;re here to provide support and develop something fun, so let&#039;s not make it stressful and unpleasant! <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}"

                        <br /> Tl;dr... be careful, be good, don&#039;t cause issues, don&#039;t get put in the corner. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
