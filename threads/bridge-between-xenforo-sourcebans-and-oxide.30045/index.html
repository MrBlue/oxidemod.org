                        <br /> I have requested something similar to this on Oxide however this is a more in depth and detailed of what I am seeking and what the compensation looks like. Please review
                        below to have a complete understanding of what I am looking to get accomplished. (Yes this is posted on UMOD however wanted to get it exposure LINK: <a

                            SourceBans, and Oxide for Rust</a>)<br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Web Side</b><br />
                        <br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>User/Group Integration between Source Bans and Xenforo allowing for a single account verses two</li>
                            <li>Create a Node that will display all bans and mute actions taken though the Source Bans page that would link up to their case</li>
                            <li>Create a permissions that can be assigned to groups that would have the corresponding flags that Source Bans uses</li>
                        </ul><b>Web and Server Communication</b><br />
                        <br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>Source Bans would communicate with Enhanced Ban System</li>
                            <li>A way to provide permissions that would apply to both the Game Server and Web Server/Source Bans<br /> – With this the manager would be able to add oxide plugin
                                permissions to the flags that correspond with Source Bans<br /> – Here is an image of how the group permissions are to Source Bans: <a

                        </ul><b>Mute/Gag</b><br />
                        <br /> If able I would like to have a plugin created that would work with Oxide and if need specfic Rust that would control communication with players. This would include a
                        Timed or Permanent mute/gag function.<br />
                        <br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gag = Cannot type</li>
                            <li>Mute = Cannot use voice chat</li>
                            <li>Have different permissions for time periods<br /> – For example Permanent Mute would require X permissions and a 20 Minute one would require Y permissions</li>
                        </ul><b>Compensation</b><br />
                        <br /> Reach out to me we can discuss that as I want to ensure competitive pricing and your own thoughts behind this.<br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Note</b><br />
                        <br /> I will be posting this request in several different locations and should this plugin be picked up from a willing person I will submit the response here. This plugin if
                        paid would be kept only to personal use and not public. If unpaid it would then be public use.<br />
                        <br /> If you have any questions, comments or concerns please do not hesitate to ask!<br />
                        <br /> Thanks,<br />
