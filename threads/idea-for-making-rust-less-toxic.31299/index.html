                        <br /> I&#039;m playing with other 4 friends and it was great.<br />
                        <br /> I originally got frustrated about not being able to choose character, but the fun I had playing the game made me forget it.<br />
                        <br /> This didn&#039;t last long thought. The server we choose was not very populated but after the first wipe many other players started. No problem there, we started playing
                        just to realize that 90% of the players at maniac caveman thieves! I not even cared about losing the material I gathered, what made me furious was that other players kill you
                        for no reason. Not happy to kill you, they also destroy your sleeping bag, what make impossible to reach my friends. We had to left the server.<br />
                        <br /> I believe that this happens because of a lack of objective once you start the game and from death being not severe enough. These players don&#039;t care if they die
                        murdering someone. There is no fear factor on starting a battle. Especially on the begining. But it ruins the experience to other players.<br />
                        <br /> I could not think on a way to make death more serious but I thought on a way to provide players an objective.<br />
                        <br /> There could be classes that players or clans of players were assigned randomly at the first time they connect to a server. This would last untill the wipe.<br />
                        <br /> There could be a the following classes: farmer, miners hunters, sellers, thieves, mercenaries (get paid to protect against thieves or by other thieves to raid
                        someone).<br />
                        <br /> Each class would have a goal end wen goals are reached some kind of reward or resource multiplier is given. Each class could also have actions that punish the player or
                        clan if done. For example: a farmer should not be able to loot someone he kills.<br />
                        <br /> I&#039;m willing to help developing this idea if someone is interested. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
