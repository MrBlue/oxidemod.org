                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml">I&#039;m looking for a plugin which would allow players with permission to build within the non-build zones of
                        monuments and quarries, but to a configurable extent. I&#039;ll show you an idea of what I&#039;d like the configuration file to look like, which will further elaborate on the
                        plugin idea itself:<br />
                        <br /> Config:<br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>maxbuildgrade: &lt;0-5&gt; (0 = disabled, 1 = twigs, 2 = wood, etc.)</li>
                            <li>objectscanbeplaced: &lt;list of objects&gt; (anything under the &quot;Items&quot;, &quot;Construction&quot;, and &quot;Traps&quot; tabs in the items section of the F1
                                menu could be listed here -- traps, containers, beds/bags, doors, tool cupboard, and locks are important)</li>
                            <li>healthmodifier: &lt;float value&gt; (modifies how much damage structures receive, or how much health they start with as a percentage modifier &lt;0-1&gt;)</li>
                            <li>structuredecayrate: &lt;float value&gt;</li>
                            <li>permission: &lt;string&gt;</li>
                        </ul><br />
                        <br /> If it were up to me, I&#039;d let players build half-health x2 decay rate wood structures within most monument zones to create much more interesting battles and
                        conflicts. They wouldn&#039;t be able to place boxes, locks, beds or TCs, but they could place chairs, camp fires, and traps (excluding the turrets). That would be so
                        cool!<br />
                        <br />
                        <br /> Notes:<br /> -I&#039;m not sure if each non-build zone has it&#039;s own identity, but if there is one for caves, I&#039;d rather it not be included. Building anywhere
                        in caves would be OP.<br /> -If the configuration shown above could be unique for every monument/zone, that would be AWESOME, but not necessary.<br /> -I&#039;d prefer this to
                        be an independent plugin.<br /> -If you&#039;d like, I could compensate you for your time if this plugin is possible. Just let me know.<br />
                        <br />
                        <b>I realize ideas like this have been suggested before, but seeing as I don&#039;t know how rust was coded I&#039;d like to make alternative suggestions: 1) Since it would
                            seem the no build zones are client side, would it be possible to send false information to the client that the area is not or was never there? 2) Imitate the player server
                            side, and detect when they click to determine the placement of structures (though the server may not know what structure is trying to be placed and at what rotation). While
                            it may not be as accurate, and would still show red structures on the client&#039;s screen, this complicated second suggestion should work if all else fails.</b><br />
                        <br /> Please let me know if you plan on working on this plugin, or need any more information. I&#039;d really like to see this become reality. Thanks. <div
