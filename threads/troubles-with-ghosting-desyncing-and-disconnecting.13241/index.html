                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> I have problems with my private server about ghosting/desyncing and disconnecting.<br />
                        <br /> Looks like people upon entering certain zones on the map, get desync or disconnected and then obviously get their character trapped there because when they connect they
                        can&#039;t get up from sleeping (because they are instantly ghosting upon connecting) or just get disconnected.<br />
                        <br /> When disconnecting happens (not ghosting) it also makes the PC disonnect from internet for just a second (we use teamspeak 3 and it loses connection when this happens),
                        and rust freezes unable to click any button on the menu so I have to close it.<br />
                        <br /> It&#039;s strange because only a few people are able to play just fine and in certain areas of the map.<br />
                        <br /> Even more odd is that I have 2 bases built, and I can play just fine in there, but when I venture outside or teleport to another place, disconnecting happens.<br />
                        <br />
                        <br /> We have tried several solutions on the client side and nothing works. (update drivers, update windows, restarting everything, cleaning cache, verifying game cache,
                        reinstalling game, updating windows, using compatibility mode, restarting modem and router, using DMZ, touching the bios, etc)<br />
                        <br /> Any tips? how do I fix this? <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
