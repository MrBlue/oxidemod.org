                        <br /> It appears you can&#039;t add new locations but you can change existing ones. I&#039;ve changed a few animals spawn locations and they are working. So possibly try
                        setting those spawn points in a clustered area if you want to force them to spawn in only 1 spot.<br />
                        <br /> I also had that 0,0 issue with the player spawns when any got disabled. So I think just setting the location will work over disabling it. <div

                                        experience with it and decided not to mess around with it for the time being.<br />
                                        <br /> It appears you can&#039;t add new locations but you can change existing ones. I&#039;ve changed a few animals spawn locations and they are working. So
                                        possibly try setting those spawn points in a clustered area if you want to force them to spawn in only 1 spot.<br />
                                        <br /> I also had that 0,0 issue with the player spawns when any got disabled. So I think just setting the location will work over disabling it.</div>
