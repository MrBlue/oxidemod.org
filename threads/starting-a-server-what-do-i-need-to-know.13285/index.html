                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> Hey guys,<br />
                        <br /> I am planing to start a Rust server in the next few days? I was wondering what do I need to know? and by that I mean, how many resources does a Rust server usually take?
                        I am planning to run a few administration plugins, some sort of an economy plugin. Pretty much all the basic plugins that most server &quot;need&quot; to function properly.
                        Obviously I could run in Vanilla, but I want to make it a little bit more entertaining. <br />
                        <br /> Would 4 - 12GB of ram be enough for a 20 - 50 player slots? I&#039;d estimate that I would have at least 50% of the slots used up during peak times. <br />
                        <br /> Thank you for your time, and help! <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>

                        </div>I am already experienced in running servers, I ran my own Rust serer before but just for myself. I&#039;ve never ran one for a community so I want to know how much
                        resources would be used, and how much. I already have a dedicated server with 32Gigs of RAM. I know that is more than enough, although I don&#039;t want to allocate 100% of
                        that RAM just for Rust as I am hosting a website on that server as well.<br />
                        <br /> P.S. NFOServers is too expensive for what they provide in my opinion. I am experienced with Linux, and managing servers in general, so support does not matter honestly.
