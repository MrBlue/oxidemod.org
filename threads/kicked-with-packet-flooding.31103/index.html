                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> So Ive seen a few others post that are similar. But I have seemed to narrow it down a little better. When someone
                        joins the server for the first time or the first time after a wipe other players get kicked with packet flooding.<br />
                        <br /> At first it seemed to only pick admin, now its picking atleast me (as admin) and a random number and random players. It only seems to happen a new players FIRST join on
                        either the server or the new map. We have 3 different servers. one is on its own and then 2 that are hosted on a dedicated machine. the one thats kicking is on that machine.
                        the other server on that machine runs fine with no issues. All three have the same version of rust and same oxide. So with everything being almost the same it would seem to me
                        to be a mod. alot of the mods are the same on both server. but there are a few others. <br />
                        <br /> My first thought was its got to be a mod that announces players joining the server. cant remember which one we started with but it was remove and replaced with something
                        else. still did it on both. I cant really think of anything else that might look at new players other then Kits. Which i have been having issues with working properly. I will
                        be redoing them completely in the next few days. If that fixes it I will report back.<br />
                        <br /> But thats my issue. Dont seem to get kicked for any other reason other then above. If anyone else is having the same issues let me know if you find an answer. <div
