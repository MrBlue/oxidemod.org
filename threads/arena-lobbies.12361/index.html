                        a specific features that don&#039;t seem to be there right now.<br />
                        <br /> In this I see people being able to join two different sort of lobbies. One with their own stuff and another with a predefined kit (could be through /kit). Once there is
                        the predefined minimum amount of people they get teleported to an area that is restricted by outsiders and restricted damage through C4 etc. They battle it out and the winner
                        gets a predefined reward or a randomly selected reward from the config file. There could also be a scoreboard which could addition /kit rewards (based on permissions) as
                        reward. So the #1 could get /kit #1 etc if they are #1 in that scoreboard.<br />
                        <br /> This is the feature that has the most feedback from my community. When i setup a vote the majority of 60players were in favor of this sort of idea. And all this on the
                        same server (not an event server). If financial aspect is an issue I can setup a fund for you on my website and I&#039;m sure people would donate to it and can be there on a
                        permanent basis as long its working obviously. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
