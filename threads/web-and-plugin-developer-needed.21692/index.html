                        <br /> i am searching another developer willing to work under Akeno Himejima Corp. we are still small but we having big idea&#039;s.<br />
                        <br /> i am searching a webdev that can also work with Plugins this is a webpage developed by a friend of me <a href="https://eubestservers.com" target="_blank"

                        the big question do you need to HTTP or can you use a Hosting company like strato or WIX for making this also the issue is that the webpage feature for payment have to do a
                        command towards the server.<br />
                        <br /> basicly i need a news section easy to edit <br /> a shop useable with IDEAL &amp; PAYPAL sending a servercommand after purchase to add the person to the group<br /> i
                        need a tool that after his 30 day purchase is finished he also will be removed<br />
                        <br /> and of course basic features like about us who are we whats our vision<br />
                        <br /> and now the biggest question $$$$ of course webpaging is new for me i pay for plugins between 5 and 25 euro per plugin depends on difficultie of what i want i have
                        already a team strong developing for me on request plugins and they well knowen in oxide community just let me know<br />
                        <br /> SERVER: [NL/EU] Akeno Himejima<br />
                        <br /> this website have to work with atleast +10 servers our vision is to have more then 10 servers running in the feature that shop is synced <div
