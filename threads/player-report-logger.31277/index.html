                        <br /> I was wondering if it would be possible to code a plugin for players to report other players (Online or offline)<br /> with a section for admins to add notes to said
                        report so other admins can see the reported players previous offences<br />
                        <br /> So there will be 2 different GUI&#039;s<br /> - User GUI <br /> - Admin GUI<br />
                        <br /> Permissions:<br /> User: report.user<br /> Admin: report.admin<br />
                        <br /> The User GUI will consist of 2 different &quot;Screens&quot; or &quot;windows&quot;, these pop upafter a user enters a command in chat : /report<br />
                        <br /> The user will see the first screen with 2 tabs namely online player or offline player<br /> So they can report current players that are online or players that are
                        offline as their offender could have logged off after the offence<br />
                        <br /> The Player list populates as per the selected tab (online/offline)<br /> The user has to select a name (it will highlight)<br />
                        <br /> and click (Report player)<br />
                        <br /> It will then switch to a second screen where the Title of it will be Player report Displaying the offender&#039;s name under the title with a section where the user can
                        enter a message of the issue they have and then submit the report for the admin to review<br />
                        <br /> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> For the Admin GUI it is a bit more complex<br />
                        <br /> There are 4 columns <br /> - Reported Players - (Player&#039;s name that committed the offence)<br /> - Report Message - (Message of the player that made the
                        report)<br /> - Reporter name - (Player&#039;s Name that submitted the report<br /> - Admin Notes - (Admin can make notes on the report for other admins to see)<br />
                        <br /> The &quot;Reported Players&quot; Column stays static with all the names that have been reported<br />
                        <br /> The other 3 Columns (Report Message, Reporter name, Admin notes) populate as the admin clicks on the different name that was Reported (Reported Players Column)<br />
                        <br />
