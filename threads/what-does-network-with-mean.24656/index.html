                        <br /> Did you mean to say:<br /> Rust is a multiplayer game, which involves networking clients together. Rust, the multiplayer game, also involves different aspects of the
                        game.<br /> Rust is a multiplayer game, which involves networking clients with each other as well as networking clients with other aspects of the game.<br /> Rust is a
                        multiplayer game, which involves networking clients together, and, at the same time, networking different aspects of the game.<br />
                        <br /> Unfortunately, none of the three possible semantically rephrased versions of your original sentence explain what that word means in the contexts of Rust plugin
                        programming.<br />

                        <br /> He was defending you, since my reply to your reply to my thread was a little mean. However, your reply seemed a bit arrogant, and so that is why my reply to your reply
                        was also arrogant. He then defended your reply by insulting me that I didn&#039;t have a simple understanding of the word network.<br />
                        <br /> Crap like this should not be welcome in a forum, otherwise immature children like him will keep others from feeling like they can freely ask questions on this

                        it was fairly obvious. You&#039;re lucky that you understood it when you saw it, perhaps that is because you don&#039;t know the other definitions of the word
                        &quot;network&quot; and so the only one that came into your head was the correct one?<br />
                        <br /> I believe it was your intention to upset me, since you declared that a &quot;simple&quot; understanding&quot; of that word would have negated the need for this thread.
                        Finally, you need to assume less about people when there is no evidence towards your assumptions. I did not appear to not be familiar with that word. <div

                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> The documentation of `CanNetworkTo` indeed contains `x networks with y` which could probably be changed a bit to
                        make it more clear on what it exactly does. This hook allows you to block or send the updates the server received from a client to another client.<br />
                        <br /> As for describing the word &quot;network&quot; in context of a Rust plugin, you simply don&#039;t. You have to see a Rust plugin, once compiled, as part of the server,
                        so the actual context would be the Rust server or game server in general. Which actually brings us to multiplayer game development which refers to this as
                        &quot;Networking&quot;. For more technical information you can view the Unity Documentation on it here: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetOverview.html"
                            target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Unity - Manual: Networking Overview</a>.<br />
                        <br /> As example you can take the Vanish plugin. When the server obtains updated information about a player it will send this information to all the players in the same
                        network group. But this plugin will, when a player is vanished, utilize the `CanNetworkTo` hook to stop this information from being sent to the other players while still
                        allowing that player to receive updated information which allows the vanished player to roam around and see everything without anyone being able to see that vanished
                        player.<br />
                        <br /> This is however not limited to hiding players from other players and such, you can do this for any entity that is available. For example, you could spawn a lootcrate
                        that is only available to a certain player or a certain group of players.<br />
