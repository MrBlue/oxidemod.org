                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> I want to launch a new server to screw around on a bit and I want it to be PvE. Can someone share their
                        experience between using the command &quot;server.pve true&quot; vice using a plugin like TruePVE?<br />
                        <br /> What are the benefits or limitations with simply using the pve command? I&#039;ve scoured the forums and numerous Google searches to find an explanation of just what
                        &quot;server.pve true&quot; does, but don&#039;t see anything official looking.<br />
                        <br /> Basically, I don&#039;t want players to take damage from other players and I don&#039;t want structures to take damage from anyone other than the player that built it (I
                        intend to use something like Magic Hammer to allow players to destroy their own structures if they want to).<br />
                        <br /> Thanks for any insight. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>

                        </div>Thanks for the insight. I&#039;ll go with your plugin! Damage reflection seems like it can become a giant pain in the ass. Ill have a look at the config file later, I
                        definitely like the idea of customizing the degree of PvE... like being able to loot corpses etc. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
