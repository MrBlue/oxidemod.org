                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> so i have an idea for changing my server into something else. Ive read through alot of plugins and havent seen
                        anything that will do what i want. I will give the idea of the server and please suggest plugins that will make it work. Im sure there are servers and plugins that already do
                        this but I havent been able to connect the dots yet.<br />
                        <br /> I want to make a server were players are forced to pick a faction/clan on first join. each faction/clan would a certain set of permissions. When the players joins they
                        will spawn in a premade building. there they will see info on both clans (as the server grows, if it does, i would like the ability to make more then 2 clans) then they pick a
                        clan. Im guessing that a chat command like /join clanA would do the trick. once that is entered the player is warped to that clans side of the map. after that all spawns would
                        be only on that side of the map. Once they enter the /join clanA it would add them to Clan A through a clan or faction plugin and the player would be added to that group in
                        oxide. i was thinking that i might give each clan access to other plugins just for that group. like say clan A can ride horses and clan B can drive cars. something like that. I
                        would also like there to be a leader of each clan. and the leader role is pasted on to person that kills him inside the clan. then from there the server works sort of like
                        normal having the plays either fight the other clan or within the clan or help the other side. whatever happens happens. <br />
                        <br /> Not sure all or any of this is possible but any help would be awesome. Ive seen some cool stuff done on other server that might help this but it seems asking a server
                        owner what they use and how they did it anyways ends in a NO. so no help there.<br />
                        <br /> from what i see plugins needed are:<br /> spawn control - to spawn them in the start building<br /> clan/faction - visible groups to be seen by players<br /> ??? plugin
                        - the one that lets them join a clan by choice and not having to be added, and added to oxide groups automatically without having to be added manually by owner.<br /> warp
                        plugin - to move them to their side of the island once clan is picked.<br />
                        <br /> the unnamed plugin that lets them choose seems to be my problem. Dont think that excises. Maybe a GUI pops up on first join and a button is there to pick which clan. IF
                        you are a plugin dev i would love to have this made. Im poor as shit so i might be able to throw a few dollars at you but i dont have much.<br />
                        <br /> any help would be awesome and think you! <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
