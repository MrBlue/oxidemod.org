                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml">So, i recently had an idea to make a server with 3 huge guilds warring, each posessing a massive castle with rooms
                        for all the soldiers. Each soldier would be a member in the guild, so they wouldnt have acces to everything however theyd all have acces to each others rooms...<br /> That
                        would end up in all the members stealing from eachother and massive problems, so i was wondering if it were possible to kind of change how the door system works.<br />
                        <br /> Currently we have the family only or family and members settings to open doors, is it possible to make it so that family, and one or two members can open the doors? You
                        could give people more of a chance with inviting them to your guild and as such have bigger guilds, and more fun.<br />
                        <br /> Could somebody get back to me? Thanks for taking the trouble if you do. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
