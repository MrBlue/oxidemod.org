                        <br /> It feels like i must of done something wrong, but i have seen others having the same compiler issue but nobody writing about a solution or what went wrong.<br />
                        [DOUBLEPOST=1452966051][/DOUBLEPOST]and while i wondered if maybe the oxide.core.dll file was a problem.. <br /> i took my already downloaded oxide update (i patched it a few
                        minutes after the last release) and pasted it over the files in the folders i already had, replacing the files in there (except a few files in x64 that was in use)<br /> And
                        then i did a oxide.reload DeathNotes (one of the plugins i had a issue with)<br />
                        <br /> And now it loads... something must of been missed when i patched. but now it works. <br />
                        <br /> So. tomorrow early morning i am shutting down my server with not so many people and doing a replacement for all files again just to be 100% sure all is good with the
                        oxide files. <br />
                        <br /> Hope this fixes stuff for others that googles, i have no idea how this happened but i am guessing some files just didnt get patched when i patched <img
