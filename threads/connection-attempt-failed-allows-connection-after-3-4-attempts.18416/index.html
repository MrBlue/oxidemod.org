                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml">Hi all,<br />
                        <br /> I have been diligently working at establishing my own dedicated, modded server that is hosted off the PC I currently play on. Everything has been going as expected so
                        far, ups and downs, and now the end of the road seems to be in sight.<br />
                        <br /> However, when I go to connect to my server from the server-list, I am given the message Connection Attempt Failed. This will persist for a few attempts, then somehow it
                        will connect me to the server. This was also the case for my brother when he tried joining my server - we are situated in the same room when we play online. I am able to
                        connect with no hiccups via client.connect localhost:28015.<br />
                        <br /> It&#039;s quite confusing to pin-point, as this is my first attempt at server hosting. I did have a few working plugins installed and when I am in-game, it runs quite
                        smooth.<br />
                        <br /> My .bat script goes as follows:<br />
                        <br /> @echo off<br /> cls<br /> :start<br /> echo Starting server...<br />
                        <br /> RustDedicated.exe -batchmode -nographics +server.ip 0.0.0.0 -server.port 28015 -rcon.ip 127.0.0.1 -rcon.port 28016 -rcon.password &quot;****&quot; -server.hostname
                        &quot;Rusty Mess&quot; -server.description &quot;Testing Messes&quot; -server.maxplayers 50 -server.seed 434994 -server.worldsize 3000 -server.identity my_server
                        -server.saveinterval 300<br />
                        <br /> echo<br /> echo Restarting server...<br /> echo.<br /> goto start<br />
                        <br />
                        <br /> I am also using RustAdminTool and have properly installed Rust:IO for the use of LustyMaps in-game, along with Notifier, DeathNotes, and InfoPanel.<br />
                        <br /> Thanks in advance for help or advice offered! Obviously, I am extremely relieved that I have even made it this far, but not being able to connect somewhat easily through
                        the server-list is slightly saddening/frustrating!<br />
                        <br />
                        <br /> Edit: Well, as many owners in the past have experienced, somehow it resolved itself. I just woke up this morning and ran the .bat file and after a few minutes it was up.
                        Hopefully it lasts <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />
