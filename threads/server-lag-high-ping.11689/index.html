                        <br /> So we&#039;ve been on a &quot;rust host&quot; for awhile and we had a lot of problems with that because server would restart every now and then followed by rollbacks.
                        This is obviously a huge problem running a rust server.<br />
                        <br /> However we now moved onto trying a ovh VPS cloud 3 server. I was a little busy looking into the cpu/memory i guess so i kinda missed the part that it only has a 100mbs
                        bandwidth.<br />
                        <br /> However our last host had server in germany, this ovh server is in france now. All players seem to get ALOT higher ping than they should and also the server itself seems
                        really slow (timewarnings) all the time and eventually it gets unplayable. I&#039;ve been monitoring the server a bit and i see its not using too much processor / memory
                        really. Bandwidth is usualy just around 1mbs wich would be then about 1/10 (10%) of max usage if im not completely wrong now.<br />
                        <br /> Sorry for the wall, but anyway someone know what could be causing this? I mean a lot of people have stopped playing on our server now for obvious reasons, and i do
                        understand them. But even with a 100 mb/s bandwidth 8gb memory should run a rust 6k map with around 20-30 people on it then i think.. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;
