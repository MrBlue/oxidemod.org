                        <br /> Now I know I&#039;m being a bit presumptuous being as this is my first post in this forum, but I was wondering if there was any way a mod could be developed to create a
                        Wall of Shame for banned members, something similar to Dynamic signs but connected to the banned players list instead of kill count?<br />
                        <br /> As there seems to be little to no support regarding what happens to known cheats, hackers, hyper-toxic players and just general a**holes, I was thinking it may be
                        beneficial to be able to create a dynamic sign that can display those that are banned from the server in question? A &quot;Wall of Shame&quot;, so to speak? <br />
                        <br /> Just an idea to try and clean some of the trash out while we lack more appropriate tools, that I think would benefit a lot of people, if only in the smallest sense. <div
