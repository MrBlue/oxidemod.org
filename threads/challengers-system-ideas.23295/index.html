                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml">Hello everyone, I am developing a series of plugins for Hurworld, one of them is a system with the statistics of
                        the players in the form of API, supporting the various plugins already developed, so that you can consult any statistics of A player in specific, kills, deaths, k / d ratio,
                        suicides, money, duels, if he owns a vehicle, if he has been killed by some animal, among other things. With the help of this plugin I am developing two more, some is a TOP of
                        players, one with general punctuation, another of kills, another of deaths, etc .; And the other is a system of challenges, which consists of going over several challenges to
                        go up the level, and when you overcome a level you are awarded a reward.<br /> I&#039;ve come a long way, progress can be seen in <a

                        that can be taken as a challenge in the game.<br /> As soon as this finished a decent version of the plugins I upload them here.<br /> Greetings and I await your comments<br />
