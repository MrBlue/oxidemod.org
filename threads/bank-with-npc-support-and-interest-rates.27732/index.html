                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml">As the title says i&#039;d like to propose an oxide plugin for rust experimental compatible with npc plugins which
                        adds a money bank into the game with a gui interface.<br /> This bank would allow people that when having money in their pockets have an urge to spend it all to avoid that urge
                        and also have a bonus, as the bank would have interest rates.<br /> If you have no money in the bank your interest rates percentage is 0%, but if you have at least 10$ it would
                        go to a configurable maximum amount percentage, and as your money in the bank accumulates the rates go down, capping at an also configurable percentage, and every few minutes
                        the server would ping you saying that the money from the interest rates was delivered to your account with the amount of money and the current percentage rates, the player
                        would have access to a command to toggle that message from showing or not and the server owner could disable the message all together.<br /> The interval between when the money
                        is sent to the bank accounts would also be configurable.<br /> The maximum amount of money you can have in the bank would also be able to be configured, and interest rates
                        could be turned on or off for servers that don&#039;t want them.<br /> Players can withdraw money from their bank accounts and deposit as well, they can also transfer money to
                        other players bank accounts at any amount they wish.<br /> Also, an other feature that would be nice to have is the need to buy your bank account before being able to use it,
                        of course server owners could disable this feature as well, they can also change the amount of money needed to buy the bank account, besides, it&#039;s a one time thing, once
                        you buy it, it&#039;s yours to keep.<br />
                        <br /> And that&#039;s the idea i had at the moment, i saw that there was no plugin for that kind of thing, i&#039;m completely inept at programming so i can&#039;t do it
                        myself, and the server i play in really could use a plugin like this.<br /> So i hope some talented dev with a little bit of time on their hands takes this idea and makes it a
                        reality.<br />
                        <br /> Thanks in advance<br /> -Railgun69 (yes that&#039;s my name on steam and Rust, i just haven&#039;t gone around to change it on oxide) <div class="messageTextEndMarker">

                        <br /> I&#039;m not sure how hard it would be to rewrite the Bank Manager Plugin. The plugin would allow you to use NPC&#039;s as Bank Tellers. Which makes the ability to save
                        your items as well as still having to take risks. The problem with the Bank for rust plugin is anyone can pull their item out (Rockets, C4, Etc) as they&#039;re about to raid
                        someone. I know that a plugin to store items with an NPC Bank Teller would create an immersive experience. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
