                        light on this for me you would be a hero.<br /> On my server last night basically talking with players, spectating, etc. All of the sudden everyone who dies are all spawning in
                        1 spot way up in the sky and falling to their death over and over. Then anti cheat starts banning a bunch of them left and right for r-superjump. Then after it had banned a few
                        the others stopped spawning in the sky for a few. In the meantime some player tells me my server was taken over by hackers and there goes my whole server population. I laughed
                        that off as I average between 40-80 players at most peak time easily but then more people all start re spawning in 1 spot in the sky and falling to their deaths. So I restart
                        the server. Doesn&#039;t help. Restart again. Doesn&#039;t help. I don&#039;t know anything else to do at that point so I do a full server wipe, brand new seed, the only thing
                        I keep is all the players blueprint progress. Get the new server installed, get oxide and all my plugins installed, and then RustWeb and get the server back up with a fresh
                        everything. I join and spawn in the air and fall to my death as does the next 5 or 6 people that join after me. All of us spawning at the same 1 point in the sky over and over.
                        I then think maybe something in a new plugin recently add so I delete about7 or 8 that have been added or updated in the last 48 hours, restart. Same thing. Now I&#039;m here
                        because I don&#039;t know where there a better community of knowledgeable people then this who might know why this is happening. Any help at all would be much appreciated.
                        Thanks I zipped up all the logs from this fresh install and few reboots and included them here.<br />
                        <br /> Ah I just saw the thread below here about the same problem. I was on a map with a 6000 size when it originally started happening but Imma wipe again right now and see
                        what happens<br /> [DOUBLEPOST=1423222694][/DOUBLEPOST]and that&#039;s exactly what it was, went to a new seed and map size of 5500 and everything&#039;s fine. That really
                        kinda pisses me off. If there&#039;s a known bug of that magnitude Facepunch needs to get off their asses and make sure there is some kind of help thread or known bugs thread
                        or something of that nature to inform people so server operators aren&#039;t freaking out when it happens all of the sudden out of the blue. Well I&#039;m done ranting,
                        lol<br /> [DOUBLEPOST=1423379043,1423220225][/DOUBLEPOST]Anyone figure something out on this because I was on a map size of 5500 for 2 days and it just started happening again
                        with over 70 people on the server and had to turn it off <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" alt=":(" title="Frown    :(" /><br />
