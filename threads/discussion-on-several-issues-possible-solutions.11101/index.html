                        <br /> 1. High external walls are showing 500/1500 health after placement on my server. I can use the Build plugin to heal them but they fall back to 500 shortly after. Anyone
                        else have this issue? Rust or plugin?<br />
                        <br /> 2. Not a bug but an annoyance... I increased the gather rate on high quality metal ore by X5 on rock nodes on my server. Since the HQ drop in nodes happens like half-way
                        through a rock (always seems to be the case) players are hitting rocks until they get the HQ drop then leave the rock like that. My server is littered with like half the nodes
                        being half farmed. Anyone ever have this issue? How did you fix it?<br />
                        <br /> 3. Not an issue but just an observation: Charcoal production seems to have been increased by 400% since patch. Nice =)<br />
                        <br /> 4. I&#039;m still seeing stacked loot crates in rad towns since patch, despite the patch suggesting something like that has been fixed. I haven&#039;t seen anyone
                        complain about it anywhere which is strange!<br />
                        <br /> 5. I&#039;m getting a lot of warnings about sv_requestfile in my RCON which seem to be tied to Signs. I&#039;m using SignArtist on my server.. Anyone getting this NOT
                        using SignArtist? The delay is over half a second lots of the time and they often happen a bunch at a time (when a user approaches a base with lots of signs for the first time)
                        and it&#039;s lagging the server.<br />
                        <br /> 6. Had a bug last night while building an outpost... I built the base, built a bunch of doors.. when I came to upgrade them two of them would not upgrade at all.
                        I&#039;d get the pie menu option fine but nothing would happen when I used the option. I tried relogging, same thing. No error messages, nothing, just didn&#039;t work. I used
                        /buildgrades to upgrade them and it worked. This was inside my own freshly built base with a tool cupboard to which I was authorized. Tried removing and re-acquiring auth and
                        it didn&#039;t help.<br /> [DOUBLEPOST=1439688834,1439571417][/DOUBLEPOST]Alright, found some answers:<br />
                        <br /> 1. Problem specific to an exclusive plugin I run on my server, my error totally!<br />
                        <br /> 2. I modified my custom gather mod to address this =) I learned though that my players are also &quot;abusing&quot; nodes by leaving non-sulfur nodes as soon as they hit
                        the sulfur yield. Apparently it&#039;s like HQM, it drops all at once so once you get it you can just move on to another rock. That&#039;s another issue I&#039;ll need to find
                        a solution for.<br />
                        <br /> 3. One of the hotfixes reverted it back to 150% what it as =(<br />
                        <br /> 6. Still have this issue, several of my players reported it as well. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
