                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> hey , i think it would be really cool to remake call of duty zombies to rust. im not sure if possible .<br />
                        <br /> but here are my ideas (how the game mode should work)<br />
                        <br /> there are npc . that can be used for the zombies.<br />
                        <br /> House (the will hit the windows only and when window wall falls there in )<br />
                        <br /> players shot the npc to get money to buy new and better weapons . the start with what ever the server owner wants .<br />
                        <br /> npc kill you in 3 hits , (maybe possible to add a few transaction more then guns like buy armor and more hp . or something like that if possible )<br />
                        <br /> objective is to get as high round as possible .<br />
                        <br /> players can only have 3 weapons . one is primary and other one is secondary and a bone knife.<br />
                        <br /> (bone knife will kill the zombies in 1 hit the first 3 rounds and double it every 3 rounds . killing them with bone knife will get you more money.)<br /> also shooting
                        the npcs with head shots will also get you more money then shooting them on another part of the boddie.<br />
                        <br /> as this is rust the can buy med kits and serigens from the shop using the money the get from killing the zombies . max 5 each stack . ammo is 60 each slot.<br />
                        <br /> repairing is also possible if npcs are not hitting the window . (repairing gives little money.)<br />
                        <br /> unlock doors using money <br />
                        <br /> other than that im not sure if anyone has any other ideas feel free to add on to it. ill update the main post with good suggestions.<br />
                        <br /> if you have anymore question or anything just post on the thread <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)"

                        <br /> if any dev wants to take on this project would be awesome . i would love to have a plugin like this on our server ! <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}"
