                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml">Since Oxide was originally released at the end of 2013 by the original developer Thomas, the domain names and
                        assets for it were always held by third-party hosts and never in the hands of the development team. We are pleased to announce that we finally have those domain names in our
                        hands! While we will not be actively utilizing the domain names, we will be keeping a static copy version with the majority of the public content from the old XenForo-based
                        website public content here at oxidemod.org for informational purposes only.<br /><br /> During the archival process, there will be pages missing, some looking a bit odd, and
                        some likely broken. We will be doing our best to make sure the majority of the content is readable and there for your viewing pleasure. The static copy will be hosted on GitHub
                        (or another static host) and cleaned up as time permits. With over 20,000 forum threads to sift through, the changes to make them clean can take some time, so we appreciate
                        your patience.<br /><br /> Aside from that, we hope to see you over at <a href="https://umod.org/" target="_blank" class="externalLink">umod.org</a>! <div
