                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> I&#039;ve got a bit of a headscratcher here. To put it simply, my server locks up until I attempt to directly
                        input anything into the server console, at which point it resumes working perfectly, but reports players for swinging too quickly.<br />
                        <br /> There does not seem to be any specific timing to the lockups, often times the server will go for 6+ hours without a lockup, sometimes after a fixing lockup it will lock
                        up again after just a few minutes.<br />
                        <br /> When the server locks up, it doesn&#039;t disconnect players or disconnect RCon, but players are unable to interact with the world/items, and any commands entered into
                        RCon do not take effect. It doesn&#039;t create any errors or warnings in any logs that I can tell. When it does lock up, the FPS and uptime counters, as well as the network
                        usage meters within the console all freeze as well.<br />
                        <br /> Sometimes once the server resumes, I get an error message like so: Steam gave us a k_EAuthSessionResponseAuthTicketCanceled ticket response for unconnected id &lt;player
                        steam id&gt;. But I suspect that&#039;s just an issue with players partially timing out when the server is locked up, rather than the cause of the lockup.<br />
                        <br /> During the lockup, I can still fully interact with the rest of the VM, with no issues. The console also doesn&#039;t crash, and I don&#039;t ever get an unresponsive
                        program warning. Looking at the resource manager on both the VM, and the Host Machine, there are no large spikes in RAM, CPU, or Disk usage.<br />
                        <br /> Any assistance would be greatly appreciated, as I won&#039;t be able to reliably get people to stay on my server if there is any instability. I am willing to try just
                        about anything, but with how sporadic the lockups are, it will be very difficult to test most fixes.<br />

                        this indication is that the Rust server works correctly and then at some seemingly random point, it locks up. Only typing on the Rust server console (I just hit enter key)
                        causes the server to &quot;wake up.&quot;<br />
                        <br /> I ran taskman on it and can see that during the lockups, the CPU utilization goes from normal, steady 30% to basically 3%. As soon as I press enter on the Rust server
                        console, it bounces right back to 30%. Most of the time, all connected players are then kicked due to &quot;packet flood&quot; or &quot;steam/eac error.&quot;<br />
