                        <br /> First off, awesome site you guys (the admins) have here! I&#039;ve enjoyed all of the plugins for my server and find the variety will be nice once everything is finished
                        and set up.<br />
                        <br /> Anyways, as you can tell, I&#039;ve made it as far as getting the server set up and plugins running. I can connect to it from the local host (&quot;connect
                        localhost:28015&quot;) and install and use plugins perfectly.<br />
                        <br /> However, of course i&#039;d like my server to be public and on the list for others to play and join. I&#039;m aware i&#039;d have to port forward the server which has
                        been my focus the past three days to no avail. On all the tutorial videos I&#039;ve watched my network page layout seems EXTREMELY archaic compared to others.<br />
                        <br /> When I open the port forwarding page and click &quot;New Custom Service&quot; I enter the name as &quot;Rust Server&quot;, have my protocol set to &quot;BOTH&quot; and
                        start port and end port both at &quot;28015&quot;. However there&#039;s one more field you have to enter called &quot;LAN Port&quot; and I&#039;ve seen no demonstration on what
                        goes there. I&#039;ve looked at my ipconfig from the command prompt and used just about every permutation possible from the whole numbers that show up (the field has to be a
                        whole number value).<br />
                        <br /> Also, when i&#039;m finished editing the custom service I have to enable it which prompts me to enter a field that requires either an IP address or device.<br />
                        <br /> My server IP is currently set to &quot;0.0.0.0&quot; and I&#039;ve made no changes to the &quot;start.bat&quot; file in my server folder. Any help would be appreciated
                        as well as any advice on the quickest way to test if your ports are open or not.<br />
                        <br /> Cheers!<br />

                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> A few simple errors, you need to set the rust server ip to the ip of your computer/machine. Go to the command
                        prompt and type &quot;ipconfig&quot; and copy the IPv4 address and set the rust server IP to that. You should also put that IP when it asks you on your portforward
                        settings.<br />
                        <br /> Also for the lanport, set that to the same port as the start and end, so it should all be 28015.<br />
                        <br /> Note: With most routers you will not see your own server on the list nor will you be able to connect to it using your public IP, however others who are outside your
                        network will be able to. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
