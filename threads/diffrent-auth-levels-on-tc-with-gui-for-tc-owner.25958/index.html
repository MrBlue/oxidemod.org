                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml">So in a clan you dont have everyone be an owner because that would just be horrible with the name changes and
                        crap... so why do we have everyone just authorize on a TC?<br />
                        <br /> My suggestion is a 3 level TC Auth.<br /> Owner: This person can not be wiped off by someone whos of a lower level. This person is also automatically added to ALL
                        turrets (Auto, flame and shotgun) placed in the perimeter of that TC and can build, upgrade and place things in the base.<br />
                        <br /> Admin: This person has as much priv as the owner but can be wiped off the TC by the owner.<br />
                        <br /> Builder: This player can build, upgrade and place things in the TC Range. This player is also automatically added to all turret auth lists.<br />
                        <br /> Friend: Players added to this list is added to turret auth lists and can only place things approved by the owner/admin<br />
                        <br /> Temp: When a player click authorize they are added to this list that will put them on the TC for 10min. Players in this list are NOT added to turret auth lists and are
                        NOT able to build or place things inside the TC range.<br />
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <br /> For ease of moving people to diffrent groups I would suggest a GUI (tho chat commands would work as well). <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
