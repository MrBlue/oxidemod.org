                        <br /> &quot;Does the RCON tool read from the server&#039;s player file? When I was running my server on a Windows box it kept a list of everyone that had ever connected to the
                        server even if they disconnected. I&#039;ve recently moved to a Ubuntu box and the <b>Player</b> tab only shows connected players. It doesn&#039;t keep track of disconnected
                        players (I assume this is because Linux servers don&#039;t have player files). Because of this, if I ban a cheater (but forgot that I should IP ban them... just happened...
                        oops) and later decide to ban their IP I can&#039;t check RCON for it to ban their IP later on. At one point (on the Windows box) I had 25,000 disconnected players. I
                        can&#039;t keep manually keep track of that many people. Could you possibly make a separate plugin that creates a file like the player file that RustAdmin can read from? That
                        would be amazing!&quot; <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
