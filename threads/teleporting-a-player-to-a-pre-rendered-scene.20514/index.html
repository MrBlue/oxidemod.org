                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> Sorry if this issue has been addressed on these forums in the past. I have just recently gotten back into rust
                        plugin development, after a year, I had gone back to some of my old code for enabling a death-match and have found some issues that I&#039;d like to resolve.<br />
                        <br /> I have a death match plugin that allows the admin to set several spawn points, hopefully within a certain area, maybe walled off or something like that. Once set up,
                        users can send a command to join the session. They are stripped of any items/clothing/etc. then equipped with a set up weaponry to the battle. When the user dies, as usual they
                        can choose to spawn in one of their bags/bed or on the beach, regardless, unless the user has quit the add-in, he&#039;s teleported to one of the spawn points.<br />
                        <br /> This is where I need help, once the user is moved they cannot see the world around them, buildings load/render in slowly and they see all of the dead bodies around them
                        fall as though they all just died. The bodies don&#039;t bother me as much as the buildings, you start to run but can&#039;t because there&#039;s a wall in front of you that
                        you didn&#039;t see a second ago.<br />
                        <br /> I assume it&#039;s because the &#039;scene&#039; has to load/render. I also assume it&#039;s because when the user initially chose to re-spawn somewhere (in one of his
                        bags for example) the game loaded THAT scene, and I teleported them to the death-match scene and there was no time to load. I tried ensuring they were &#039;asleep&#039; after
                        the re-spawn but that didn&#039;t work as well as I hoped.<br />
                        <br /> TLDR;<br />
                        <br /> How does one teleport a player programmatically to a location but have THAT location loaded/rendered so they don&#039;t see the weirdness (as described above)?<br />
                        <br /> I also like to know how to remove dead bodies.. the flies.. the flies are horrible. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
