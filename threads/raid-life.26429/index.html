                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> Raiding is a fact of life in Rust, and everyone that moans about it should play on a PVE server. Now that I have
                        offended many of you, how about my Plugin request.<br />
                        <br /> I would like a plugin that each day will automatically Paste bases into un-populated areas of the map. As the server owner I would build a series of bases ranging from
                        shit shacks to decent group bases. Using the copy paste plugin I should be able to save the base layouts etc (I&#039;m unsure if it saves chest inventory or not). But what I
                        want is a plugin that would select from this list of bases and add them to the map based on how far into the wipe we are (e.g. day 1 =&gt; shit shacks or small bases, day 3
                        =&gt; furnace bases, day 5 =&gt; clan bases) etc.<br />
                        <br /> I would also like the plugin to be able to use HumanNPC to create &quot;Players&quot; and have them sleeping in the bases to make it look a more authentic offline
                        raid.<br />
                        <br /> I think this plugin would add A LOT of life to a server and would give people more motivation to play through the wipe rather then raid a few bases and move on. When I
                        played solo, by the time i was ready to raid all the bases had already been cleaned out and people had moved on.<br /> This plugin would also have the added bonus of giving
                        raiders more targets to minimise the chance of your base being offline raided <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)"
                            title="Smile    :)" /><br />
                        <br /> Cheers<br />
                        <br /> P.s. An extension to this plugin would be that once a base has been added to the map, each day it has not been raided it could possibly level up e.g. a day1 shitshack
                        could become a day2 smallbase, and eventually a day5 furnacebase. or perhaps the loot could level up etc. In short, it would be great to have simulated growth/life over time.

                        </div>Yes, I was thinking of having scale-able loot tables that depending on the type of building would some days be really good and some days crap. Fully randomised loot would
                        be a red flag that this base was generated. <br /> What I would love to see is that bases added by this mod would nearly be indistinguishable from normal player bases.<br />
                        <br /> All that said though, you are dead right. If there isn&#039;t enough randomisation then long term&#039;ers will easily be able to avoid shit bases and only target the
                        nicer loot. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
