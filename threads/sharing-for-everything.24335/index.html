                        <b>Hello Everyone!</b><br />
                        <br /> Modded Rust is there to expand what rust has given us and make things easier! So this plugin idea is for that exact reason too!<br />
                        <br /> I am looking for a Sharing System that will brake down what you share with who!<br /> So there are about 10 things in Rust that players share, these are.<br />
                        <br /> -Door Codes<br /> -Guest Door Codes<br /> -Tool Cupboards<br /> -Turrets<br /> -Remove <i>(/remove and Hammer Remove)</i><br /> -Friendly Fire<br /> -Location
                        (Rust.io)<br /> -Homes<br /> -Box Codes<br /> -Set Home <i>(ability to set home in your base)</i><br />
                        <br />
                        <br /> There are many plugins that share these just with one command that shares them all to who you want. <br /> There is no plugin that allows you to say exactly what you
                        want with who you want!<br />
                        <br />
                        <b><span style="text-decoration: underline">3 EXAMPLES</span></b><br />
                        <br />
                        <b>A Normal Player</b><br /> Say the command is <i>/share</i><br /> and you want to share with your friend, let&#039;s call him Eric, your doors.<br /> You would type in chat
                        <i>/share Eric DoorCodes</i><br /> Oh and maybe also Friendly Fire<br /> Then type <i>/share Eric FriendlyFire</i> and <i>/share Eric Location</i><br />
                        <br /> This would mean he would see where you are on Rust.io and not get damaged by you. Can can open doors you have set the code to without having the ability to build in your
                        base or go place he should not as there are Turrets and not get into the boxes.<br />
                        <br />
                        <b>The Friendly One</b><br /> You meet a friendly player on the server name Bob,<br /> So you just want to not damage him if you every see him again so just do <i>/share Bob
                            FriendlyFire</i> with out effecting Rust.io and sharing your location with him all the time.<br />
                        <br />
                        <b>The Griefer</b><br /> You have a friend, Charlie, who loves to Grief, but you are still friendly and all. <br /> You type <i>/share Charlie SetHome</i> and <i>/share Charlie
                            Turrets</i> and <i>/share Charlie GuestDoorCodes</i><br /> This will only allow him to get into the base around the base with out being shot by Turrets without letting him
                        remove doors or build thing around/in your base or remove walls.<br />
                        <br />
                        <b>LIST OF WHO YOU SHARE WITH AND WHAT</b><br /> Now lets say you notice that someone has been building in your base and not very well, how can you remember who you gave
                        permission to use the TC type <i>/sharelist ToolCupboard</i> and it would give you a list of players that you have allowed to build.<br />
                        <br />
                        <b>SHARING ALL &amp; <b>UNSHARING</b></b><br /> Now it come to those people that you fully trust, it will take time having to do <b>10</b> <i>/share Eric &quot;*****&quot;</i>
                        and then another <b>10</b> <i>/share Bob &quot;*****&quot;</i> so instead <i>/share Eric All</i> allows everything to be shared, even later on you can say do /unshare Eric All
                        or /<i>unshare Charlie GuessDoorCodes.</i><br />
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b>SUMMERY</b><br />
                        <br />
                        <span style="text-decoration: underline">Commands could be as followed..</span><br />
                        <br />
                        <i>/share &quot;PlayerName&quot; &quot;TypeOfShare&quot;<br /> /unshare &quot;PlayerName&quot; &quot;TypeOfShare&quot;<br /> /sharelist &quot;TypeOfShare&quot;</i><br />
                        <br />
                        <span style="text-decoration: underline">Types Of Shares Would Be:</span><br /> -DoorCodes<br /> -GuestDoorCodes<br /> -ToolCupboards<br /> -Turrets<br /> -Remove <br />
                        -FriendlyFire<br /> -Location<br /> -Homes<br /> -BoxCodes<br /> -SetHome<br /> -All<br />
                        <br />
                        <br /> Many thanks for taking your time for reading this. I am will to learn how to code on this and be a part of making this plugin if possible. Look forward to hearing what
                        others have to say and what we can do!<br />
