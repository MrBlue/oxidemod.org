                        <br /> I am new to this site, I do however, own my own server and have used quite a few plugins. The server performed fine, there were no errors and everything was OK,<br />
                        <br /> What I am trying to achieve though is a good PVE server, so I was looking through the plugins and although I have found a few I will use there is some Ideas I have and I
                        do not know which plugins to use to achieve this.<br />
                        <br /> I was hoping that If I came here and made a post, maybe you guys could help me.<br />
                        <br />
                        <b><span style="text-decoration: underline">My Goals:</span></b><br /> I am trying to build a server that offers a PVE environment, But would like PVP areas for those that like
                        PVP<br />
                        <br />

                        <b>1)</b><span style="text-decoration: line-through"> PVP Zones. I was wondering if there is a Plugin for this? I was hoping I could make all the Monuments a PVP zone, My
                            thinking is, Higher quality Loot, but at a Higher Risk. If the plugin only offers one PVP zone though, that would be fine</span> <b><span style="color: #ff0000">Sorted

                        <b>2)</b> <span style="text-decoration: line-through">I currently run the &quot;AbsolutMarket&quot; for trading. Although I have found out that it never shows how many items
                            the seller wants in the trade. So I&#039;d still like a Trade Economy to encourage gathering and trading. Is there a way to fix this?</span> <b><span

                        <br />
                        <b>3) </b>Is there a Plugin for a player to declare war on someone, but only happens if both parties agree and so it can only be approved by an admin?<br />
                        <br />
                        <b>4) </b>Is there a plugin that records records, such as Longest animal kill with a Hunting bow etc and so it pops up when a record has been broken?<br />
                        <br />
                        <b>5) </b>I have so far never been able to make the Backpack plugin work, can anyone be so kind as to let me know how to get this working?<br />
                        <br />
                        <b>6) </b>Any suggestions by any of you guys would also be very welcomed and appreciated.<br />
                        <br /> Just so you know the current server setup I have at the moment runs the following, Although I want to change to a PVE with PVP zones so it will obviously change :<br />

                        <br /> Thats all I run. As stated above, the server runs perfectly with those, apart from the Backpack plugin that never worked, Me and others would press &quot;b&quot; to
                        bring it up but nothing.<br />
                        <br /> Any help at all regarding the Plugins for the PVE/PVP zones would be great, I know this is a long post and I am sorry in advance.<br />

                        </div>I&#039;m sorry, I understand what you are saying. <br />
                        <br /> 1) The PVP zones one, I found the &quot;Zone Manager&quot; plugin that offers exactly what I was after. Although, Im finding it hard to understand the working of it and
                        set the PVP area around the monuments. But I will keep trying to find tutorials. <br />
                        <br /> 2) AbsolutMaket was not showing how many of the items the seller was asking for. I found out that to fix this, go into the Normal Rust Settings menu and scale the
                        Interface GUI to 0.9 and then it showed fine. I think it was happening due to the 1920x1080 resolution, but once the scale was changed to 0.9 it was perfectly fine. <br />
                        <br /> I also thank you for your reply, I gave &quot;Player Challenges&quot; a try and it is perfect. thank you.<br />

                        </div>Thank you for your reply. I have now got rid of the backpack. also, thank you for the advice of looking etc. I have been downloading a load of plugins and trying them
                        out. As soon as I figure out &quot;Zone Manager&quot; I will try to write up a feedback for it.<br />
