                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> This isn&#039;t related to development but maybe useful for server admins and players in-general. I&#039;ve
                        spoken with hackers and friends of hackers and they&#039;ve given me a little about of insight about how ESP works with rust.<br />
                        <br /> - Apparently they can see chests inside of bases but they can&#039;t differentiate sizes, so large and small chests look the same, they also can&#039;t see what&#039;s
                        in them from the outside. Also if you have more than 20 chests apparently this will appear as simply a big blur for some esp hacks. So my advice is put a tremendous amount of
                        empty chests throughout your base, and try to not make your loot room(if you have one) obvious. I did this with a 10x10 base on battlegrounds, and had 20/30 1x1 rooms with a
                        single empty chest and a door, only 1 contained the real loot. Hackers had a very tricky time finding the loot when they offline raided us. (I know this because they told me,
                        and had to destroy 85% of the base to find it)<br />
                        <br /> - ESP hackers can detect players from a distance and not only that but they can see what items you have on your person. So if you&#039;re raiding and have rockets/c4
                        it&#039;s easy for them to find you across the map and lock-on. There&#039;s a very popular server admin that has a live monitoring rust.io type system that shows them locking
                        on to people in a distance and helps him ban them. I could link if permitted, is a video.<br />
                        <br /> - ESP hackers can see hidden stashes, i&#039;m working on a plugin for the public that keeps stats on stashes discovered, by who, and what they got. I figure as admin
                        i&#039;ll use the plugin and store extremely hidden stashes around the map to try and bait them out. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>

                        you want to know whether ESP have access to some sort of information, ask yourself the question whether the client needs to know that piece of information at all times.<br />
                        The one with ESP hackers knowing about the inventory of other players was unexpected, though. Are you sure that they can see those? I&#039;d have imagined all containers
                        (inventories, chests) work similarly in that regard: Content is networked when accessed. They can certainly see the stuff that you&#039;ve got currently equipped (in your hand,
                        on your body) because that needs to be networked for displaying them. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>

                        want to see boxes, so they can still see without getting all blury.<br /> But yes, put boxes in all your rooms and they won&#039;t know which one to go, that is true.<br />
                        <br /> 2) usually they arent stupid, they don&#039;t directly lock<br /> They can only see at 500m max as rust don&#039;t send them informations of things further then 500m
                        away.<br /> And at 500m you can hear rockets / C4, so yeah they can lock on the location, not because of ESP, but because of the sound.<br />
                        <br /> 3) Yes! i already made this plugin and it&#039;s running on my server. works well, i have couple problems with stashs spawning in narrow fields so that can be seen by
                        anyone. But i alraedy found couple hackers with that <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
                        <br /> 4) Another way is to check who is locking on animals. The best way to level up fast is to kill animals. Some players kill a LOT of animals, when it&#039;s actually hard
                        to find them normally. Found couple ESPers like that, they would lock animals from 250m away.<br />
                        <br /> Generally catching ESP is hard, even with training, if they know what they are doing, it&#039;s hard to catch them.<br /> It requires a lot of admin work. <div
