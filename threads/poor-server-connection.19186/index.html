                        <br /> I&#039;ve had my server running for a little over a month now, and for some reason some of the players have poor latency even though they too live in the United States
                        (where I&#039;m hosting). A couple players admitted to having poor home connections, but it was especially bad on my server versus an older server they played on. At the same
                        time though, some players have no connection issues whatsoever on my server - even from France or Great Britain. It really is hit &amp; miss. For myself, I always see &lt;10
                        ms.<br />
                        <br /> In the past 3-4 days, the server kicked everyone (myself included) due to a Flooding Protection violation a few separate times; maybe 4 times all together. There were
                        only about 6-7 players each time this happened, and again this morning when only 3 players were connected. Is this because my server is losing connections with the clients, or
                        something else? Is it a plugin issue? I have around 50 plugins installed and my connection speeds at 50mbps down and 5mbps up using a cable broadband connection (obviously
                        wired via ethernet port). Could this be my ISP throttling bandwidth or is it server side or something else? When I watch the resource monitor, the network does occasionally
                        spike (maybe every 10 minutes), but honestly I don&#039;t know what would be classified as normal, expected, or dangerous.<br />
                        <br /> I don&#039;t have extensive knowledge in networking, but I am willing to learn what I can to at least narrow this problem down and try to get to the bottom of what could
                        be causing this. Some other info; there&#039;s around 105k entities on the server and around 50-60 sleepers if that means anything; also the tick.rate is set to 20.
                        There&#039;s around 3-4 players on at any time, but rarely past 5 (peaks to 10-12 on good days).<br />
                        <br /> My ultimate question would be; is this something that is being caused by my server that I can fix, the players client/home connection, or my ISP? Any help/input at all
                        would be greatly appreciated!<br />
                        <br /> Thank you for reading <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
                        <br /> Edit: I forgot to mention that the error Steam Auth Timeout happens more often than other players. And like I said,<i> any help </i>at all is appreciated. <div
