                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> Rather than a straight request this is more of a suggestion, or Idea.<br />
                        <br /> I would love to see a Ninja themed server. But in order to achieve this there should be some Ninja related plugins. following is a list of the plugins I have already
                        considered would be great for the theme.<br />
                        <br /> #0) - Ninja Ranks - this should work similar to ZLevels where the more you use the ninja techniques the greater the effect would be (and potentially you would need a
                        ninja level of say 5 in order to use X ability).<br />
                        <br /> #1) - NeverDrown - If you have a pipe in your held inventory then you can stay underwater without drowning, The number of pipes should/could represent the depth you can
                        dive before drowning<br />
                        <br /> #2) Kakurenbo no jutsu (hide) - I know there is already a hideandseek plugin, and that plugin would almost be perfect for this, however in order to use it as a
                        &quot;Ninja Theme Plugin&quot; it would need some tweaks - to be made simpler.<br />
                        <br /> #3) Kawari no jutsu - (evade) - If the player has wood (or some other specific item) in their held inventory they can replace thier body with that item and teleport
                        their body X meters away to safety.<br />
                        <br /> #4) Bunshin no jutsu (clone) - Use the HumanNPC plugin to spawn 1-5 clones of yourself and get them to scatter or follow your path giving you a meat sheild etc, the
                        clones would auto die after X seconds (depends on your ninja level).<br />
                        <br /> I&#039;m sure there are many others you guys can think of, so feel free to add to this list.. and I gaurantee if there is ever a ninja server I would play the shit out
                        of it.<br />
                        <br /> NOTES: <br /> &gt; when any effect is used it should play the small smoke effect or something similar.<br /> &gt; all jutsu (skills) should be keybind-able (but not
                        forced).<br /> &gt; Skills could cost hunger for activation (making candy canes the ultimate MP)<br /> &gt; Unfortunately, we cant change the run speed, jump hight etc.. would
                        be perfect for a ninja server. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
