                        <br /> I hope this isn&#039;t in bad taste, the plugin author is actually really good at keeping up with my issues however I am currently in a time crunch and I don&#039;t know
                        what his schedule is and this is fairly urgent. This plugin is important and I need it before I move to our dedicated server today, it currently works fine it&#039;s just a
                        small format error of sorts. I don&#039;t know much about C# but i&#039;m fairly confident that if you can read C# then this issue should be easy to fix. Since I have paid for
                        this plugin I do not wish to share it to everyone but if you wish to send me a PM we can work together through there. I am just hoping someone can do this just for the sake of
                        helping, I do not have any money to pay right now... Like I said, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s hard to fix, I&#039;m pretty sure I know exactly what&#039;s wrong as I&#039;ve
                        done a lot of testing this morning.<br />
                        <br /> In advanced, thanks! <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
