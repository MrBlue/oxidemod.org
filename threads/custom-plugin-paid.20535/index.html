                        <br /> I&#039;m looking for an experienced coder that has the following knowledge:<br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>Basic oxidemod coding</li>
                            <li>Can work with proper formatting and player join/leave functions</li>
                            <li>Has expierence with SQL / MySQL-based plugins. (need to know how to read from DB and such)</li>
                            <li>Knows how to block people from joining the server or kicking them if unauthorized with a message</li>
                            <li>Can make a plugin that uses configurations so the plugin is configurable</li>
                        </ul><br /> This request will be paid for.<br /> Add me on Steam to start our cooperation: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/iShot_sub" target="_blank"
                            class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Steam Community :: iShot</a><br />
                        <br /> To put things into perspective this is a short explanation of what I&#039;ll be needing:<br /> I need to have a plugin written that checks when a user joins if they are
                        in the database (making the database is already done, only reading needs to be done) with their STEAMID64 and either kicks them with a custom message (configurable) if they are
                        not in the database or lets the play if they are. Simple <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
                        <br /> I live in the GMT+02 (with summertime) timezone so anything close to that makes communication a lot easier!<br />
                        <br />
                        <br /> Thanks in advance,<br />
                        <br /> iShot <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>

                        </div>You are totally correct, the plugins out there give this ability for free already. However I need it to be linked to an external database, including a whitelist file and
                        allow admins and moderators by default because the amount of people that will sign up for this is going to be so high that any manual method will give me a fulltime job each
                        day.<br />
                        <br /> To put things into context, this plugin will be used to lock certain servers for subscribers of a certain very popular (8,814,385 total views at the moment of writing
                        this) Twitch channel out there. The subscribers of this twitch channel can use a webinterface to link their STEAMID with their Twitch account and after checking they are
                        actually subscribed I add information to an external MySQL database. This would be a near impossible task to do manually because I expect at least a few hundred signups each
                        day.<br />
                        <br /> I understand there are options out there but this situation is just something more specific.<br />
                        <br /> In other news, I was contacted by an oxide coder and he started working towards a solution for this problem so my offer no longer stands. <div
