                        <br /> Basically players could rank up by getting kills. There was a bandit and hero path you could follow depending on who you killed. Once players reached a certain rank they
                        could access a kit and were assigned a player tag as well. I think there was something to do with calling other players (police rank) for help as well.. My memory is hazy on
                        this but I&#039;m sure someone out there would remember. <br />
