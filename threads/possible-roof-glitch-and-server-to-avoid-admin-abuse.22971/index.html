                        <br /> After that I did contact the admin about this roof exploit we were blamed for from there I added him on steam to go into further detail, I don’t know how to recover the
                        rest of the chat history but he was very kind towards it. Said it didn’t look like anything was wrong, he then later replied with this <a

                        on more during the night, or a couple hours after that response he decided to go on and attack our base. As you can see here <a

                        friends took screenshots cause it was mainly crazy so I don’t have too many screenshots since I myself wasn’t on, there was apparently up to 6 helis sent out, even players from
                        the server was asking whut was up. He probably did this because his clan and another one they allianced with decided to be really salty with us. During the first conversation
                        we had I did mention the two clans and how his members were part of it, so it was quite confusing as to how he did a complete 180 on me.<br />

                        time I was asking for the picture to where the glitch was happening but he would not give it and eventually deleted me and banned me on both the community forum and eventually

                            target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/a/H1Plc</a> I should have realized he was a bit shady due to the fact that he said that his
                        members/friends were never being rood in chat, and was asking if they were threatening banning us for using this exploit through voice and not chat, which wasn’t true cause
                        they spammed it in chat a good amount<br />
                        <br /> Tbh I just want to get this out there just in case anyone else was considering joining, this server actually has a decent amount of people on night time pacific we
                        usually have nearly 40 people on so there’s a good amount of people playing imo. I also want to give light just in case this is an glitch as i do not know. Thank for your time
                        if you managed to reach this far.<br />

                        <br /> TLDR, I’m salty bout an admin basically cheating to take down our base just cause his members/friends were probably crying to him. I don’t usually go out of my way to do
                        this, but we spent a good amount on this and kinda tilting to have such a cheated ending to it. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
