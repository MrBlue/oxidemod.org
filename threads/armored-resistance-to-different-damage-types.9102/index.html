                        <br /> I&#039;m working on an alternate config using the ItemConfig and ConstructionConfig mods (thanks to the creator of this mod, it&#039;s awesome) and I can&#039;t quite
                        figure how to get / modify this information.<br />
                        <br /> In the ConstructionConfig generated by my server, I see resistances for twig, wood, stone and metal but not for armored. I figured it might just be the same as metal,
                        but with more health, but the numbers I&#039;m computing from this do not make sense, so I suspect there&#039;s some data I simply do not have access to.<br />
                        <br /> In fact the one data that doesn&#039;t seem to compute is the damage resistance to explosions. Using metal values, I come up with 2x C4 to blow an armored wall which is
                        close but no cigar. I keep reading it does 420 dmg, so I could figure it that way but I&#039;d rather use actual values from the game.<br />
                        <br /> Any help would be appreciated.<br /> [DOUBLEPOST=1433424307,1433362972][/DOUBLEPOST]Ah, nevermind I found it. I had a rounding error, turns out the armored tier uses the
                        same resistances as sheet.<br />
                        <br /> That said I have another question semi-related to this. I changed the health of different construction pieces and it&#039;s working well in game but the displayed health
                        is still normal in game. For instance, I modified wood so it takes 2 c4 to blow up. I don&#039;t know the exact health it has but say it has like 800 and c4 damages it by 420.
                        When I look at the piece in game, I see it at 250 health.. if I lay 1c4 it actually goes down to 380, but it&#039;s still showing 250... One more c4 and it blows up.<br />
                        <br /> Is there any way to have the game display the proper numbers? Or maybe hide them altogether? I&#039;d rather not see it than see a number that is wrong. <div
