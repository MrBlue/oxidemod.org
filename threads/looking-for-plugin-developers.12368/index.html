                        <br /> We are looking to network with multiple people who are very well versed in C# and are extremely comfortable with Oxide. Time efficiency and availability is a must when
                        it comes to whom we are looking for. The flexibility to update your plugin as Oxide updates is important to us as well. As more Rust updates get released we&#039;ve noticed a
                        trend of plugins breaking or not working properly or being abandoned all together. If you&#039;re also confident in your ability to fix someone else&#039;s work, then we want
                        you! Of course we don&#039;t expect anyone to work for free, we are willing to pay developers for the work they do for us as long as it&#039;s reasonable and affordable.
                        Demands for personalized and custom plugins are high for modded servers. We are interested in building relationships with people that will benefit both us as server hosts and
                        the plugin developers involved in this swiftly expanding environment that is Rust and Oxide.<br />
                        <br /> If you&#039;re interested in speaking with us feel free to PM us here on these forums or email <a
                            href="mailto:support@therustyspittoon.com">support@therustyspittoon.com</a> with the subject &#039;Dev work&#039; and we can set up a date/time to discuss details.<br />
                        <br /> We look forward to hearing from you!<br />
                        <br /> Regards, <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
