                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> I have been running a server for almost 3 months now via HostHavoc hosting service, and every wipe it seems that
                        random parts of the map develop a habit of kicking players for &quot;k_EAuthSessionResponseAuthTicketCanceled&quot;. <br />
                        <br /> These parts of the map don&#039;t start out bugged like this, but a few days after the wipe the ares begin in what seems to be random places. When enough time is spent
                        in the area, the player&#039;s client becomes unresponsive and kicked. The players then get stuck on &quot;Receiving Data&quot; when trying to connect until the game lets them
                        in ages later but instantly crashes. Only way I have found of getting them out of this glitch is by killing their sleeper or teleporting them away.<br />
                        <br /> The only way to get rid of the issue I have found is to wipe server, but then they start appearing again like I said a few days later.<br />
                        <br /> My server currently has these mods on: <br />

                        anyone else has this problem or has a fix for it please tell me<br /> [DOUBLEPOST=1460490627][/DOUBLEPOST]I might also want to add there has been no errors at all in the
                        console, aside from the ProjectileID which most people seem to be having. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
