                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> Hey Server admins - I have spent a lot of time trying to figure the best way to assign a moderator to my Rust
                        Server. I understand the commands, but what I am really after is what you assign your moderators to do.<br />
                        <br /> For example, should MODs con <span style="color: #59b300"><b>green</b></span> in text? Some people bitch and moan they are cheating which they are not and I have posted
                        logs to prove it. If they are <span style="color: #0080ff"><b>blue</b></span> and say they are a MOD some people do not believe them.<br />
                        <br /> Is it better to have them switch back and forth as needed? So for example, if someone is stuck, or needs some help that requires an admin, they could switch to MOD
                        privileges and then switch back to Player status after. <br />
                        <br /> My main goal is to just have my Moderators Warn/Kick/Ban if needed. There are very few instances where stuff needs to be spawned unless we are running an event. And in
                        that case I am usually on to help facilitate. I work a FT job so I can&#039;t be on all the time.<br />
                        <br /> As a follow up, I trust both of these people who are moderating, I just am not sure the best way to go about it.<br />
                        <br /> Thank you in advance for the reply, suggestion and the time you took to answer the questions.<br />
                        <br />
                        <span style="text-decoration: underline"><i><b>~BL</b></i></span><br /> [DOUBLEPOST=1485447741][/DOUBLEPOST]Oh and I forgot to add that part of the reason for the GREEN con in
                        chat is they like to Raid.....there are those that cry foul and that they cheated....which once again the logs say other wise. It&#039;s almost a lose | lose situation to me.
                        Thanks! <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
