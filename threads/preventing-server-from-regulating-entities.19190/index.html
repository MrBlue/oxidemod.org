                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> Im building my own resources management plugin to set up trees, minerals &amp; animals.<br />
                        <br /> The problem is the Oxide server initialisation kicks in at the beginning and says things like<br /> &quot;<b>field-arctic (spawn population) has 22 objects, but max
                            allowed is 13 - deleting 9 objects</b>&quot;<br />
                        <br /> Then my own code sees theres X trees missing and adds them again at random positions.<br />
                        <br /> Its not a bigproblem gameplay-wise but for my plugin it could lead to future problems, longer server load times and less importantly players could be led to believe
                        someone farmed an area when no one was arround.<br />
                        <br /> So, any ways to avoid that automatic cleanup ? <br />
                        <br /> Ive already set up &quot;spawn.max/min_density&quot; to 5000 but it didnt seem to change much (note that I have spawn_max/min_rate set to 0 because Im managing the
                        respawn myself) <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>

                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> Its hard to tell. Ive started working on it after we got unhappy with how admins managed a server we were on and
                        we decided to make our own. Since we were going to have our own server, we might have well have some custom mods - and since Oxide is so powerfull I went ambitious <img

                        <br /> So far here&#039;s what&#039;s working / mostly working :<br />
                        <br /> - Define a set number of trees for the whole map, or a &quot;ratio&quot; which will let the plugin decide the number depending on the map size (so more like
                        density).<br /> - Define a value making trees more or less grouped together<br /> - Same thing for ores (quantity/density/group)<br /> - Resources respawn instantly when
                        collected BUT away (customisable value) from all awake players. We decided on this rule to fight against clans with too many players : they&#039;ll farm their area a lot and
                        hence will have to walk farther and farther to find stuff. Also since asleep players dont prevent respawn, smaller clans / solo with less player &#039;uptime&#039; have more
                        chances of having resources arround them when they reconnect.<br />
                        <br /> - Animals : spawn in various sized group (min, max, chance curce (to make large or small group more exceptionnal), wandering arround with a group leader (wip), awareness
                        / fear / runAway system (wip). Basically the specifics of the animals are redefined (speed, acceleration, reaction time, view range &amp; fov) to give them a specific place in
                        the player progression : no ranged weapon and dont know how to hunt ? catch chicken. Can sneak up a bit ? boars. Light ranged weapon and can sneak a bit ? Stag. Good ranged

                        clans vs large clans, making hunting / scavenging for food much more important (food becoming actually an important raid-worthy resource), making home invasion more fair for
                        offline players, making homes attack/defense less about building a thousand walls and more about fighting and overall trying to make players do something more than build a fort

                                    <div class="quote">Its hard to tell. Ive started working on it after we got unhappy with how admins managed a server we were on and we decided to make our own.
                                        Since we were going to have our own server, we might have well have some custom mods - and since Oxide is so powerfull I went ambitious <img
                                            src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
                                        <br /> So far here&#039;s what&#039;s working / mostly working :<br />
                                        <br /> - Define a set number of trees for the whole map, or a &quot;ratio&quot; which will let the plugin decide the number depending on the map size (so more
                                        like density).<br /> - Define a value making trees more or less grouped together<br /> - Same thing for ores (quantity/density/group)<br /> - Resources respawn
                                        instantly when collected BUT away (customisable value) from all awake players. We decided on this rule to fight against clans with too many players :
                                        they&#039;ll farm their area a lot and hence will have to walk farther and farther to find stuff. Also since asleep players dont prevent respawn, smaller clans
                                        / solo with less player &#039;uptime&#039; have more chances of having resources arround them when they reconnect.<br />
                                        <br /> - Animals : spawn in various sized group (min, max, chance curce (to make large or small group more exceptionnal), wandering arround with a group leader
                                        (wip), awareness / fear / runAway system (wip). Basically the specifics of the animals are redefined (speed, acceleration, reaction time, view range &amp; fov)
                                        to give them a specific place in the player progression : no ranged weapon and dont know how to hunt ? catch chicken. Can sneak up a bit ? boars. Light ranged
                                        weapon and can sneak a bit ? Stag. Good ranged weapon and good at sneaking ? Horses.<br />

                        </div>Awesome! I look forward to its release and to check it out. Also this is semi-unrelated but taps into what you were saying about balance. A clan member mentioned to me
                        how massive clans will just farm up 1 guy(using his created tools, eating his cooked foot, etc...) and then they&#039;ll be able to raid extremely fast and have access to all
                        items. I was thinking of ways to lessen this abuse, I could give little to no xp for using others items but that kind of takes the fun away, and I saw an XP balance plugin
                        released that gives new users the average amount of xp, but that is forcing others to work for their xp and newbies get it freely, so I don&#039;t really like that idea. I
                        don&#039;t know just something to think about. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
