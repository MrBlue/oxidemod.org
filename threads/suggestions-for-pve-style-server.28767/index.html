                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> Although I love Rust and how the game is played, I have purchased a second server that I want to turn into a
                        fight server. I love pubg, and used to play counter strike source gun game for years..<br />
                        <br /> I am looking for a way to have an awesome custom built small map where its 100% dedicated to some form of combat. I saw a video on youtube where half the people turn to
                        zombies, and then its a battle of humans vs zombies with all real players. I think that would be awesome if it is available. If it is, can you point me to what mods could make
                        that happen?<br />
                        <br /> Also, if that sort of mod isnt out there, or cant be put together at this time; what is the next best option? I saw that there is a gungame mod, but wondering if it
                        would be more fun to fight animals or if there is a way to even make that sort of arena? I would LOVE to make a pubg style server if thats possible but disable building and
                        just load places up with little buildings that have awesome loot inside of storage trunks? Is that white zone thing possible for a pubg style of server? I would love to hear
                        what people think. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
