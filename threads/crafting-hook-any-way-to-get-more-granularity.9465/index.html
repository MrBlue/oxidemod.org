                        <br /> I&#039;m trying to make the tool cupboard act as a workbench from Legacy, giving the user a boost too crafting if he&#039;s within range of a tool cupboard he is
                        authorized on. I got the tool cupboard auth part figured out and I can, on the OnItemCraft hook boost the craft speed of items depending on if the player is authorized or
                        not.<br />
                        <br /> That said, it looks like the OnItemCraft is called only once for a queue AND also that when you queue new items, these items immediately call the OnItemCraft hook
                        (instead of triggering it when they are actually processed).<br />
                        <br /> Is there any way to get a callback of some kind when an item starts being crafted (whether it&#039;s in a batch or later in the queue)?<br />
                        <br /> I want to avoid players queuing a million things and just leave the cupboard range and still have the benefit.<br />
                        <br /> I could probably use a timer and just flush the queue when he leaves cupboard range or some gimmick like that but it probably isn&#039;t the best way.<br />
                        [DOUBLEPOST=1434560479,1434399848][/DOUBLEPOST]Still stuck on that one. I did make progress... Even though I can&#039;t seem to get notified each time an item starts crafting,
                        I do get called every time one finishes crafting, at which point I have access to the current build queue. <br />
                        <br /> I&#039;ve been able to modify the queue to make it all instant, but I can&#039;t seem to change the rate. When I look at the first item in queue, sometimes the endTime
                        will be at 0, sometimes it will have a big value. The zero from what I gathered using the decompiler means &quot;use the time from the bp&quot; but the bp is actually a
                        reference to the bp everyone uses, so I don&#039;t want to modify that value.<br />
                        <br /> So questions, has anyone cloned or created a new bp &quot;on the fly&quot; and could this work? Could I just take the task and create a new bp that is the identical copy
                        of the bp in question, apply a multiplier on the crafting time there and just plug it back in the queue?<br />
                        <br /> I&#039;ve managed to dequeue and requeue stuff with different values, so I know I can alter the queue pretty easily. I could take the first item, decrement the amount by
                        1 and reform the queue with a new element at start that contains 1 of that cloned blueprint with reduced time.<br />
                        <br /> On a related note, did anyone figure out how the endTime works? I know it&#039;s like a tick count and it&#039;s being compared with values from Time, but its it in
                        milliseconds, seconds, server ticks, etc?<br />
                        <br /> Real close to having a legacy-type workbench mod... a little help would be appreciated <img src="{{ '/assets/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1"
