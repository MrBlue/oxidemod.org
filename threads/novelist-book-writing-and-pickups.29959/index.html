                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> Looking to try and see a plugin made that will allow players to turn notes into a book that you can page through
                        via a &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; button gui (Essentially letting users page through notes strung together to make a readable book)<br />
                        <br /> The end goal here (I run an rp server) is to be able to have players create books with stories histories, faction lore and the like that can be saved and made available
                        from era to era. As well as a copy of the rules I can let people get in game)<br />
                        <br /> A stretch addition to this project is being able to preserve those books in a server file (preferably plaintext) for me to be able to make certain books eternal ( ie
                        carry between wipes). And be able to be added to loot tables (an additional drop from barrels) so that my players can find lore books as they are out farming as a way to
                        introduce then to lore and role-play with the best examples of what my server has had to offer in it’s lifetime.<br />
                        <br /> This is not something I would want to hoard for myself/my server as I believe plugins are for the benefit of all servers/communities and you would be free to
                        release/make available as you wish.<br />
                        <br /> I recognize this might be a difficult plugin though I suspect that it is possible. If I have learned anything from seeing my former developer work his magic there is a
                        lot that can be done in rust that hasn’t been done yet.<br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Compensation</b><br />
                        <br /> In a magical ideal world this would be a freebie out of the love of rp and the desire to create a unique plugin. But I’m realistic and suspect that’s not an option so if
                        it’s not im open to see if we can find something we can agree on to get this accomplished. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
